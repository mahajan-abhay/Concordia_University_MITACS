0,"This is a winter review.  For all winter activities like snowshoeing, tubing, cross-country skiing, skating, you can check the conditions on the website: lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/act…It costs adults $20 for 2 hours of ski or snowshoe rental.  They offer 3 sizes: S, M, L.  You simply need to reserve online and pay upon pick up at the rental trailer close to the Pavillion.  The snowshoe trail is loosely indicated and takes you all the way to the back of the Montreal General Hospital at the halfway point and circles back to Beaver Lake.  It's got uphills and downhills so it's a good workout.  Depending on the trail conditions, it can take as little as an hour or up to 2 hours to complete this trail.  With the trail a bit compacted by earlier trekkers, the trail only took us 1.5 hour to complete. Parking availability isn't too bad in the winter as people are coming and going constantly so spaces free up periodically.  That's because there's only so much snow activity that one can have in a day.  I think it would be much more difficult to find parking in the summer when people want to stay longer. The parking wasn't cleared so the snow was pretty thick in the lot.  Fun place to bring your own gear to trek across the snow, slide down the small slopes, your dog for a walk or skate on the refrigerated rink.  The skating ring has the longest lines as they limit the number of people allowed on the ice.  On a Saturday afternoon, there were probably a few dozen of people waiting in line for the skating rink.",5,1/16/2021,Aimee H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oW9PoxLCSMwZ6EEjKuPNjw,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
1,"Parc du Royal has a character all on its own and it's the place to go if you're looking for an awesome Montréal scenery. It's like NYC's Central Park- except Parc du Royal has that high peak almost giving you that 360° panoramic view. Postcard-perfect views? Hell yeah. We've visited the park on our first Autumn Montréal trip a few years ago, then a few more times during the winter after that- and the landscape is just jaw-dropping and gets better every time. We've driven up, but this is the kind of park where you can seriously take it up several notches and work your quads on a hike or just a quiet stroll if you want. Parc du Royal brims with tons of loops, turns, entrances and exits. It's like the heart and soul of this area where it gives us a true taste of the park life.",5,8/23/2020,Mercedes C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ooHF-vRzlkyN9UEVMKocAQ,"Bronx, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
2,"This park provides a fun amount of physical activity while hilking to the top, and a rewarding picturesque view from the top, of Downtown Montréal. I would definitely recommend this as a Must for tourists given that it is just a couple blocks from the Montreal museum of fine arts and McGill University. For those who are with someone not afraid to go to the top at dusk or at dawn I truly recommend hiking to the top near sunset it sunrise to get the perfect photo. I cannot really comment on anything besides the view from the look out as it is all I really saw while at the park. encore une fois en françaisCe parc offre une activité physique amusante tout en se hissant au sommet et une vue pittoresque enrichissante du haut du centre-ville de Montréal. Je recommanderais certainement cet endroit comme un must pour les touristes étant donné qu'il se trouve à seulement quelques pâtés de maisons du musée des beaux-arts de Montréal et de l'Université McGill. Pour ceux qui sont avec quelqu'un qui n'a pas peur d'aller au sommet au crépuscule ou à l'aube, je recommande vraiment de marcher jusqu'au sommet près du coucher du soleil au lever du soleil pour obtenir la photo parfaite. Je ne peux pas vraiment commenter autre chose que la vue depuis le belvédère car c'est tout ce que j'ai vraiment vu au parc.",5,8/28/2020,John S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xHMq2fBArXBp881TVlRt5g,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
3,"Parc du Mont-Royal or Mount Royal Park is like the Central Park of Montreal. Unlike several city parks, however, this one contains a mountain. It's a small mountain just west (only a couple blocks) of downtown Montreal. The city of Montreal got its name from Mount Royal. Pronounce it like ""Mont Royale"" and you'll see what I mean. Mont Royale, Montreal. The park is huge, covering almost 700 acres, and the mountain rises as high as 764 feet.We stayed in an Airbnb on the east side of the park, pretty much on McGill University campus, on Aylmer St. We walked from our Airbnb, past Percival Molson Memorial Stadium and McTavish Reservoir, and hiked to one of the high points on the mountain: Chalet du Mont-Royal (yelp.com/biz/chalet-du-m…). I highly recommend it. I'm not sure where else you can get such elevated and wide-sweeping views of the Montreal city skyline.From where we started, at Pine Ave W and Peel St, the hike took us less than 45 minutes and it was a leisurely hike. We took breaks to rest and take in views as well as took a detour to see the Mount Royal Cross. The Mount Royal Cross is in an opposite direction, but not far from, the chalet. The Mount Royal Cross isn't giant like Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. It's a simple 36-foot-tall see-through cross with light bulbs on it. If you're headed to the chalet, you might as well check it out. The founder of Montreal, Paul de Chomedey, sieur de Maisonneuve, placed the original cross on Mount Royal in 1643 to thank God and the Virgin Mary from sparing the colony from flooding.I think if you take a brisk, non-stop walk from where we started, you can reach the chalet in 20 minutes or less, certainly 30 minutes or less. We did encounter one nice city view on the way up and back down, between the chalet/cross and our starting point. The park, in general, was clean and not much differentiated it from other public parks in major cities. The trails were mostly dirt/gravel. There were benches throughout the park. On a Saturday evening around sunset, it was busy with a diverse mix of people -- locals, tourists, students, families, young, old, etc. You do have to climb a decent amount of stairs so I wouldn't recommend this hike for the elderly.On the way down, the trails lacked adequate lighting, so we used the lights on our phones to help us see.",4,2/8/2020,Daniel B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,"Atlanta, GA",Parc du Mont-Royal

5,"Beautiful little park in the Montreal metropolitan area. This place is beautiful during the dark of winter as well as in the heart of summer. Watching the snow fall during the winter is so magical, almost like being in a snowglobe - here in the summer, there's usually pianos set up for people to play music, people strolling about enjoying the weather, and a gorgeous view of the city from the top.",5,8/14/2020,Carol L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LKaEiBYGBnB8Df1hUyEnLA,"New York, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
6,"We did not come to Montreal prepared to climb a mountain, so when the kids suggested we do so on our recent vacation, we had to take our city-clothed not-too-young selves up that mountain.  Note: There are two possible ways up that we discovered.  (I'm sure there are a million more).  One is to wind your way up wood-side where you run into a cafe that has swings and tables a third of the way up.  The other way is to take stairs all the way up.  We were glad we took the woodsy approach, although I must confess I was a bit concerned to discover that we still had two thirds of a mountain to go when we reached that cafe.  The view was already gorgeous. I could have been perfectly content at that point, but by golly up to the top we had to go! I DID it.  This old gal might have been slower than the other three, but I huffed and puffed it up and made it back down those gazillion stairs.  So however you make it to the top (lots and lots of folks took vehicles, do know there is a bathroom inside a small cafe (down yet more stairs), where you will also see a teeny museum that will let you know it's not really a mountain, but a mere remnant of something that I can't remember, because my brain couldn't fathom that I had climbed anything less than a MOUNTAIN.  NOTE:  we weren't the only people who got lost trying to figure out how to come down.  There was a detour sign that appeared to go up instead of down.  After trusting our instincts (WRONG), we had to turn around and go back to that detour sign and actually follow it, which led us to those stairs that most others were using to go up and down anyway.  Killer stairs.  Lots of them.  We were glad to be going DOWN.  Overall it was a very enjoyable hike with a sense of accomplishment for this Gal who is not known for her outdoorsy ways.",4,11/23/2019,Lori R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fM_UsuFAYu2TVUqJiYAKsg,"Raleigh, NC",Parc du Mont-Royal
7,"Mount Royal Park is beautiful and worth a visit, whether you're coming in the summer or winter to visit Montreal. It's a beautiful park with many  trails with vantage points at the top overlooking the entire city. In the winter, there are opportunities to snow shoe though the trails and both winter & summer offer opportunities for a beautiful overlook of downtown Montreal.So how do you get to the overlook? In my instance, daylight was running out and I simply Ubered to the Chalet and then walked down from there. You can do this, find a trail to walk to the top or take the stairs directly up. Either way - definitely carve out some time to explore this park when you're in Montreal!

10,"Just essential big huge green space in these crazy times. The air, the wide open spaces, they're just what we all need right now. The most fun bike ride you can do is to do the work all the way up to the top and then enjoy coasting (flying) down the wide paved trails that wind from top to bottom. This wild fun relieves some of the stress built up right now, especially when you do it at dusk and shoot out into the cool evening streets of Montreal.",5,7/30/2020,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
11,"Parc du Mont Royal is a must when you visit Montreal. If you want a (free) view of the city, this is the place to see it. It's about a 20-minute hike up many, many stairs but it's not terrible. It's doable. Just make sure you go on a cooler day, and you have plenty of water at hand. They have other, longer trails, but we didn't have the time or energy to do those. We drove to the park, and were able to find (paid) street parking nearby pretty easily.I saw in some of the other reviews that it's a great nighttime view, so if I ever return to Montreal, I'll give that a shot!",5,8/27/2019,Mel T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hwSSM8Jn29dXRW4ym-roDQ,"Hoboken, NJ",Parc du Mont-Royal
12,This afternoon I walked to and climbed up to the top of Mount Royal (I've done it a few times in the past).The stairs are at the top of Peel Avenue.  It's not an easy climb up!  There is some repair going on so I had to detour along a path. The view of the city are worth the climb!Heading down was a lot easier than going up!,5,9/25/2019,Teena D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O3pSxv1SyHpY4qi4Q16KzA,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal

14,"One of the true gems of the city, Parc du Mont-Royal (Mount Royal Park) is a must visit for any first timer to Montreal or someone looking to get a great view of the city. A large series of hills created as a result of a volcanic eruption hundreds of years ago, this area has become a symbol of the city and a mountainous landmark defined by its history.There are a number of ways to navigating through this magical place. First, one can hike / walk / climb their way to the top. It will take time and is a good group sweat-together activity. The leisurely, scenic route is through the woods where there are various group friendly sites along the way. There are a number of other trails, but those take even longer. Going up through the stairs is the more direct route and is a great way to enjoy the view, but remember there will almost always be people behind who will have to go at your pace. Bring a little water and some nice shoes.Then there is the bus. For a handful of dollars ($10?), one can ride the bus from downtown Montreal (#11 or #711) all the way to the top in very little time. This is particularly handy for those who are in a slight rush and is the preferred option for most tourists. There are a number of sites throughout the mountain, but the Chalet is the one that most folks are gunning for. It has an incredible view; the picturesque one that is on virtually every postcard. On top of that there is a cafe with food / drink, bathrooms, and a place for souvenirs. Good weather months are clearly the time to go, though I'm told winter time there are a lot of fun activities happening all around the mountain. Tourists are going to be in full force, which means photos / selfies without someone in them might be a challenge.",5,12/15/2019,Jando S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,"Queens, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
15,"A absolutely beautiful place to people watch and see the views. You need to be in pretty good shape for the hike, lots of steps. There are bathroom facilities when you reach the top and a restaurant, just snacks. There is also a water fountain to refill your water bottle.

16,"I'm so ashamed of myself.  My friends and I tried to walk to the top of the hill but we gave up and called an Uber..LoL I blame the heavy brunch we had minutes before visiting that made us sluggish. I thought it was pretty cool that the park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the person who also designed New York's Central Park. We came mid-day on a Saturday and it was filled with other tourists, joggers, picnickers, dog walkers and bicyclists. We stayed at the overlook for awhile and took pictures of one another before venturing off down the walking path. I really appreciate quiet moments with nature in the heart of the city. If I lived in Montréal this would definitely be a place I'd come to recharge. Not on a weekend of course. It's way too crowded with tourists. Maybe at sunrise. I'm sure that would be beautiful.",4,10/31/2018,Brooke F.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TulmqD11y9PX3ISUWRRktA,"Washington, DC",Parc du Mont-Royal
17,"Our day in this park was a picture perfect Spring day. It seemed that all the students from the nearby universities were there sunning themselves trying to catch some rays after a long harsh Canadian Winter. The sun beams warmed our backs as we strolled through the numerous pathways that the park offers. We enjoyed listening to the native children speak French and tried to understand what they were saying with our limited command of the language. I actually did better reading signs...like where to pay for park parking which was very reasonable.The walk around the lake was very picturesque. There are also a few museums in the park. You can get information on that at the Visitor's Center near the parking area.Once we left the park, we found a viewing area where you can see the whole city of Montreal. It was a great place to take pictures!",5,5/5/2019,Kathy C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9GUuNKZinw7JxT2nG3jSmg,"Brooklyn, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
18,"Since it was a humid day, we took the bus (i.e. Bus# 11) to get to Mount Royal. We found that there's two areas where you can see the view of Montreal.1) Bus stop ""Belvedere Camillen-Houde"": This would be the Mount Royal Lookout and you'll mostly see trees and some of the buildings. 2) Bus stop ""Remembrance / Chemine du Chalet"": This would be Mount Royal Chalet area. This is the place to be and you'll see the NICE view of Montreal. The chalet has restrooms, a cafe, and a small gift shop too.We also hiked a trail to see the Mount Royal Cross. It was a bit difficult to find even though I used Google Maps to navigate. I wished there were more signs along the trail tho.Overall, I could come back to Mount Royal if I visit Montreal during fall season just to see the foliage. I'm sure the view be a lot prettier with colorful leaves.",4,9/15/2018,Linda T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RXIeMdM988krQQDj6cXwJQ,"Queens, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal
19,"The mountain is a must see when in Montreal. Think of it like a Central Park up the mountain. A few stairs up from the street level to get to the trail walkway. The walkway is a gradual slope or you can take the stairs that cuts through parts for a short cut. There are also small narrow paths through the trees, this is quite steep and you need to watch your steps a bit. Some people say the walk up the mountain is 30-45 minutes, which I don't understand. We spent almost four hours walking up, walking around at the top and then down.When you walk up, the first building you reach is Maison Smith which has a free exhibition, a cafe that serves sandwiches, quiche and such. Public access to the restrooms downstairs. There was no Wi-Fi to connect to. Legs were killing and an uber ride back down would have been nice lol. There is a very nice lake area just next to Madison Smith. Then you can keep walking up and shortly after reach the Mont Royal Chalet, where you can get great views and photo opportunities of the city skyline and gaze across the river and mountains. The chalet looks a bit like an old style train station hall inside, again here there is a cafe that serves coffee and cakes. The restrooms are downstairs under ground. There is a walkway that takes you in a loop around the mountain top. I wish there were more walkway options that take you down to different parts of the city without having to cut through the very steep and hard to follow paths. Also wish the signs would show distances between each part of the mountain better. At the top there is a cross, Eiffel tower style, obviously a lot smaller, something to do with the founders of the city, although I believe they didn't reach the top, rather just the plateau. I would recommend skipping the cross unless you do the full loop around where you will see it anyway. It looks like a construction element rather than a commemorative cross. They could have done something more graceful with this one. If you happen to go up in one of the high rise building in downtown, you can see the cross at the top. There are a lot of local joggers making their way from the bottom to the top.",4,10/6/2018,Matt G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=188nNkbt92KZoF4QtF7ApQ,"Morrisville, NC",Parc du Mont-Royal

That is a mission and a half, especially after first climbing the giant straight up street before the mountainside. #BePrepared #Hydrate #HydrateAgainBut once you're up...It's quite lovely at the top. Views are nice. Lots of little ""dicky dee"" ice cream and drink people in the main areas. Had a Art Pop in pina colda flavour the Friends of Mont Royal stand. However, dont suggest the lime coconut flavoured one. We all agreed it wasn't great.Chanced a 2nd visit a couple months after my first ever visit. Stairs up was way easier when properly hydrated! Take a look inside the building at the top! The cafe is totally worth a stop. It's at the opposite side of the building from the view. Their pastries and coffee are excellent. The date square definitely hit the spot!Once you head out on the paths, it's super easy to take a wrong turn though.

Numerous picturesque views of the city as well. It's a little slice of natural paradise in a big city.Of course, no visit is complete without the required photo op at the top with the Montreal skyline in the background. Parking is reasonable: $3/hour but only $10/24 hours max. Personally, we like to drive up and then walk down into town and eat out way through the city, then burn it all off by trekking our way back, all uphill.It's a favorite locale to visit when in Montreal and well worth it.",5,6/1/2018,Stephanie S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5FJSrMA8z-ZxkXPhV-72OA,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
22,"This was an excellent experience during our visit to Montreal. We were staying in a downtown hotel hotel so just check up Rue Peel to the main entrance to the never-ending stairwell up to the top view.  It was a sunny blue sky day so the walk up, the breezes through the trees, and the subsequent view from the top was absolutely amazing. Remember to take bottled water with you to remain hydrated. At the top, the atmosphere was nice and as is the case with many of the parks, there is a piano player at the top creating a really nice atmosphere and ambience. We traversed the 339 steps to the top where we went to the Kondiaronk lookout as well as the Mount Royal Chalet. If you're not up for the stairwell up to the top, consider the bike pathway to the top which I'm sure is much easier.  A truly memorable experience and great way to get some of that fresh Montreal air!",5,7/1/2019,Ethan T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=tk5MOjFzceNj28vmJfyQbg,"Orlando, FL",Parc du Mont-Royal
23,"Seeing the photos of sweeping views of Montreal from Mont Royal I knew I had to make the climb during my visit. I had an uber drop me off in front of Maison Smith which is pretty much where the path starts to walk up. Its a very big park with lots of parking and many lookout spots. The day I visited Mont Royal was the first really nice day Montreal has had in awhile. It has been a long winter and you could tell how happy people were to finally get some sunshine and be in temps greater than zero. That being said there were lots of people enjoying the outdoors. Tons of folks were hiking the paths with families and dogs.  It really isn't a far climb to the main lookout spot. Approx 10 mins at an average pace. You get amazing views of the city and great photos here. There is a lodge with a cafe, gift shop, bathrooms. There are many paths that venture from the main one for hikers to explore. The main path also continues further to reach the cross (croix du mont royal).

It was pretty steep (which was not ideal at times since I'm afraid of heights!), but the breathtaking view was totally worth it! Once I made it to the top, I was so happy with myself! :)There was a stop about halfway up the hill to purchase water bottles and ice pops at a fairly reasonable price. My suggestion is to still bring your own water bottle along though. I wish I had brought one to keep myself hydrated the whole way!Not in for the full hike? No worries! You can drive part of the way up so that's an option!Whatever you decide, Parc du Mont-Royal is definitely worth your time!

The key overlook that provides you with the ""money shot"" of the downtown skyline directly beneath you, however, is a short walk off the main drive behind the chalet.Currently, there is a tremendous amount of construction along park roads, so traffic going in and out (even buses) can be severely delayed. So, skip the exhaust fumes and make a nice, hilly hike out of it.",5,8/5/2017,Vincent L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA,"Oakland, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
34,I think this is the central park of Montreal. We took the 11 bus to get here and we walked around taking the nice weather and view and the lookout point. it was packed on the weekend when we went. i would not recommend driving here. I would maybe walk up to park if I had a hefty breakfast or a normal breakfast for my standards. There are restroom downstairs the visitor center. The water fountain works and spits out CLEAN crisp clear water.Needs a korean taco trunk near the bus spot. Then this park gets a fifth star.,4,9/10/2017,Chris L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EpIlKrJJBOkBrX01Ms-i0Q,"Westfield, NJ",Parc du Mont-Royal

37,This is truly the best part of Montreal for me!  So much greenery and nature and hiking in a big city is almost unheard of and Parc Du Mont-Royal really delivers.  You literally feel transported to another place and we loved the peace and tranquility that it offers.  My favorite part is the chalet and there are many paths to reach it including those infamous stairs.  We ended up having Uber drop us off at a different lookout point towards the bottom of the park and walked about 45 minutes to reach the destination.  That path is easy and relaxing so if you are with kids or the out of shape friends or the elderly or people wearing sandals (me) then I would suggest taking that route.,5,7/11/2019,Monica G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xxB5F6TJ4J1MlNufCdqz2Q,"Alhambra, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
38,"Beautiful park, very open and spread out. If you are a serious walker then you can cover a lot of ground. If not, I'd suggest driving and parking around the various stops the park. We stopped at the Smith Maison and the Summit.Something I learned is that the Summit is where the overlook is. The overlook is the highest point in Montreal with the best views. There seemed to be some confusion on what spot this was on TripAdvisor so, to be clear, it's the SUMMIT. There is a pretty decent stair climb to get to the top. We got a bit turned around because of the different signs we tried to follow and wandered through some pretty slippery / muddy trails. Had to be extra careful. Not for the faint of heart. When you reach the top it's a beautiful open air almost amphitheater like area. There were street performers and people selling (slightly overpriced) ice pops. The environment is fun and people are sitting around, relaxing, and enjoying the sun.Tip: there are bathrooms located in the large building up the steps.To me, it was well worth the hike.

41,"We three sisters enjoyed our climb up through and almost to the top of Mount Royal (Parc du Mont-Royal) Park (there is a cross on the true top of it, a bit higher up than the welcome center). We chose the stairs which are very well maintained, not overly strenuous, but, if you need a break there a few landings on which to do so. Try early morning to avoid the crowds. The view from the promenade at the ""top"" are of Downtown, and other parts of the city, as well as the St. Lawrence River off to the left. Make sure to stop in at the beautifully restored chalet-like visitor center; not only does it have activities for kids (telescope, coloring pages, etc.), but stuff to keep us adults entertained and educated also. And bathrooms. And a cafe. And a gift shop.The ceilings and woodwork are beautiful. Not sure if the story I was told was correct, but I heard that these were former Canadian Mounties barracks.

42,"At the top of this city-park mountain you can breath in fresh air! There's several trails starting at various points on the big hill, and meander down to the street level. We visited this park in the late afternoon on a Wednesday and it was quite populated. Both locals out for a walk and tourists walking around searching for that perfect picture. Awesome panoramic views of Montreal! What looks to be the most popular lookout gave a 180 degree picture of downtown montreal and many of the ethnic neighborhoods around the city. The Observatory Lookout gives a different scope of the island, including their Olympic stadium, which is now used for sporting events, concerts, etc. it's open to the public, which I think is awesome that it's not just another defunct Olympic structure that once was, and now is nothing (Beijing!). I liked the Chalet building near the summit of the mountain. The stone on the outside. Gorgeous high wood beams lining the entire open hall, on the inside. There's a gift shop inside that has Shirts, postcards, pictures, and trinkets. Also, at the other end of the open hall is a guest services desk that has cool FREE males of the islands!!",5,6/18/2017,Gwen W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JzP5uJjhZb0Vj8J_bn3mOg,"Columbus, OH",Parc du Mont-Royal

Took the road back to an overlook of the city after dark. Great views!! There were a few groups of uni kids hanging around drinking beer and smoking pot; although they didn't bother us, it might be a concern for some.

It had AC which was great and a nice escape from the heat.I would recommend walking it earlier in the morning since when we got there at noon, it was filled with tourists. All my videos had the background noise of the tourists talking or tourists in the view. If you love dogs, people walk their dogs along the trail, too.

48,Awesome view of Montreal from atop. There's two ways to get to this viewpoint. One is to park  on Pins Avenue and hike up about ten flights of stairs (it took us about 20 minutes). It's a great work out and the view will literally be breathtaking. The other way is to park at the lot near the top and walk less than ten minutes to the viewpoint. I've done both and I would recommend the stairs if you want a good workout and recommend the closer parking lot of the less physically fit people.They have a restaurant of some sort at the top for you to buy refreshments if you get hungry.

49,"The Mont-Royal Park in Montreal is the quintessential spot to see the city. It is a great starting point for any trip to the beautiful city, and gives you a sense of the expanse of the metropolis. It is great any time of year, even in the sweltering heat of mid-summer. Bring some water, and take note of parking spots, as you don't have to force elderly members of your party to hike far if you know where to park. It's a beautiful area, and very popular, without feeling overly crowded. The main point of interest is definitely the lookout point over the city, but there are plenty of trails, green grass, and even a reservoir to explore. It's the perfect spot for a mid morning walk, an afternoon saunter, or for a great view of the sunset.",5,9/23/2016,Michael B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gk7QzENtPjq6gRznGkvcOA,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

Since then, we visit quite frequently and especially come to watch the sunset over a picturesque Montreal skyline! We always go to the peak where everyone is just taking pictures or chilling, enjoying the fresh air from up above!

52,"The hike up to the Chalet of Mount Royal is a sweaty workout but definitely manageable.  The view is worth the sweat and tears!  The photos do not do it justice since they lack the spatial element.  There is so much open space and sky up at the Chalet. My friend and I took the most direct path up Peele Street from McGill's campus.  We walked on gravel and climbed up a lot of wooden steps.  There was more climbing than walking so we didn't find wearing flats to be a large issue but the small pebbles do get annoying.   99% of the people wear sneakers/athletic shoes so I recommend bringing an extra pair of shoes if you can.  At one point, there was a continuous staircase of 256 steps, which was the final set before arriving at a flat surface near the Chalet.  It was an intense 15-minute climb in total!From the Chalet, most people walk to the famous Cross.  We headed to bus #11 instead, which took us down to Le Plateau neighborhood.  It's a charming area with a lot of colorful houses, their winding staircases to the second level (French architecture?), murals, coffee shops, boutiques, and the famous Schwartz's Deli for smoked meat (pastrami).",5,6/3/2016,Jing X.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=A08xF_ykmsWQV0ypYA8wkA,"Brooklyn, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal

I guess I wanted to get away from the tall buildings that I see in Miami.After I walked over the Beaver Lodge (I think its called) to go snow tubing. There wasn't enough snow to ski but this was so much fun! It was 9 Canadian dollars a person to use a tube the entire day. And if you had your own sled you could spend the day there for free I think.

We Ubered up the hill to the cafe. On the way up, we saw a lot of people walking, running and biking up. If we were to come back here, I'd definitely try trekking up the hill.When we arrived at the cafe, we noticed many, many people. I mean, this place was packed! There were families, couples and people just walking and jogging all over the place. There are a few main trails to take, so we took the one up to the chalet. It was a short .5mi hike up and only took us about 10 minutes from the cafe. The view from the chalet is just gorgeous. You can see so much of Montreal.

58,"A co-worker, upon hearing that we were going to be in Montreal for a few days, suggested to me that I do  my long run up Mont Royal. Now, when he said ""up Mont Royal"", he neglected to mention that there are two versions of ""up"". He knows me - knows that I always take the stairs. Plus, he's a super smart guy - you'd think that that one tidbit of knowledge about me - stairs taker! - would have clicked into a thought along the lines of, ""She'll probably take the steps up Mont Royal, too...""I had this wonderful plan, which I proposed to my husband on our last full day in Montreal: we'd walk from our hotel (which was on the Rue Saint-Denis) to Mont Royal, spend a bit of time there, throw in a quick run, and then walk from there to La Banquise for a lunch of poutine. He was hesitant, but finally acquiesced. I can be quite convincing.So it was that we left our hotel - me dressed and ready to run, him in his normal clothes and running shoes. It was hot and steamy that morning, and we had nothing to drink on us. The only things I brought were our camera, my sunglasses and a bottle of sunblock. Yes, I can be quite crazy sometimes, too.The walk to the Mont was beautiful, as we passed right by McGill University. The grounds are gorgeous, and everything was so lush and green. We didn't have much time to stop and linger, as it was starting to get even hotter as we walked, and we shared the very real fear that the heat would do me in.We climbed on deceptively steep hill, passing faculty housing, in order to get to the base of Mont Royal. By the time we got to the top, I was sweating profusely and we were both sucking wind. Not willing to give in, we paused at the top (to take pictures, of course!) before we rounded one small bend and tackled the first set of stairs in front of us.I was full of energy and excitement at that point, so I ran up the first flight of steps. Nothin' doin'! My husband caught up to me, warning me to take it easy. I scoffed at him, and turned to tackle the next flight of stairs. Still a piece of cake! I got to the top of that flight, and saw a small incline ahead of me, which I subsequently conquered in record time. It was at that point that I started to feel a bit of the burn. I wasn't about to admit it to my husband, though, as he was still admonishing me for being reckless.Scoffing with much less vigor, I turned around and noticed that in order to get to the next set of stairs, we had to cross a path. I further noticed that people were walking across the path in both directions. Being the dummy that I am, I didn't stop to think what that could possibly mean. No, I was too focused on the next set of stairs to contemplate paths and their eventual meaning!The next flight of stairs...well. They beat me. I'm not too proud to admit it! We had to stop halfway up - for more pictures. It was beautiful up there, but not very restful, as all we heard were the others hiking up the stairs: feet pounding, breath coming in ragged puffs.The final set of stairs were just flat-out rude, but we'd gotten that far, and by this time, it was my hubs who was bound and determined to get to the top. We made it - barely - all the while loudly praying to the hydration gods that there'd be a vendor or a fountain at the top. And do you know, once you best that last flight of steps, you have to climb up a rather steep incline before you get to the terrace?But, the TERRACE! What a view! It's SO worth it (even if you're sticky, sweaty and splotchy, like I was). And yes, they had a glorious drinks vendor, who quickly passed over a couple bottles of Gatorade (bless her).The view, as I mentioned, is breathtaking. You've got a panoramic view of the city in front of you, and the (mostly empty) chalet behind you. There's a small store inside, plus some tables and chairs, and an all-important restroom area.Leaving the terrace and the view behind, if you follow the path out the opposite way, you get to the rest of the park, which we were told was designed by the same guy who helped design Central Park in New York. It's very lush and green, with lots of trails and wildlife (the squirrels are super bold, and we saw one beautiful owl).I left my husband sitting on a bench to do a quick run, and about a mile and half around the mountain, I realized I recognized where I was. I briefly thought I had come full-circle, and that my husband would be around the next bend, but NOPE! I'd run a path that took me back to the last flight of steps! I was staring up at the stairs that nearly broke me, and every fiber in my being was rebelling against the thought of going back up those wooden stairs. So, I turned around and ran right back the way I came from.The trails are well-maintained, and very scenic. They're also well-traveled, so there was always someone for me to wave at or throw a pained smile to (did I mention it was hot and humid that day?)Definitely worth the effort, no matter which way you go!",5,9/13/2015,Jessica S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,"San Diego, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

62,"As a California boy relocating to Montreal, one thing I really missed was the outdoor life: hiking, trees, mountains, nature. And because I have been without car since I've moved here, the only types of nature I can go to have to be public transpo accessible. Enter the lovely Mont Royal, Montreal's Central Park. I've done all kinds of things here. Drove to the viewpoint that overlooks the northern (or is it western?) part of the city. Did the New Years 5k run in the snow. Biked through the cemetery past Beaver Lake up to Mont Royal Chalet. My go-to activity is to get off at Peel Metro, walk up Peel to the base of the mountain and take the stairs up to the Mont Royal Chalet. After resting and enjoying the view, I go back down about halfway and cut a left towards the Rachel Street entrance of the park, hike through some forest, and end up at Jean Mance Park. On a sunny Sunday I might catch the Tam Tam drummers. From there I get on Av du Mont-Royal, picking up a Kouign Amann or a quick espresso from Kahwa Cafe, then catching the Metro back home.

We started our hike at the bottom of the hill, and made the trek high up the very long and what seemed like endless stairs, to a woodsy and picturesque snowy trail path. It was a slow climb up the hill but once we reached the top, a beautiful Chalet with sweeping views of downtown Montréal awaits us. Please be warned! Except for the stairs, the snowy trail path isn't shoveled and some of the terrain can be icy and slippery making it difficult to walk up the hill.

64,"Massive park with lots to see. We went on a 95 degree day so only went to visit the Chalet. We took the Orange line to the Mont Royal station and from there we hopped on the 711 Bus which took us up the mountain. It costs us $3 per adult each way with a free transfer from the train to the bus. We were also told that our 7 year old was free! There are a few stops on the mountain so be sure to check the map to see where you want to be close to. We got off on the stop closest to the Chalet. By the way, there was ample parking there near the Chalet, which we were warned would be pretty filled. I am no sure how much is costs though. Once getting off the bus we walked about 5-10 minutes uphill to the Chalet. The Chalet is beautiful, offering amazing views of the Montreal skyline. There were two ice cream vendors there, who were making a killing on the hot day. There was also a massive Pavilion there which didnt seem to have much but offered shade. Bathrooms maybe?! It was very hot in there (no air conditioning) and smelled pretty bad. Besides offering amazing views, there was also a public piano there, which a few people took it upon themselves to play and entertain the crowd which was definitely a highlight of our visit. After taking a few pics we made our way back down to the Peel Avenue exit. This involved going down lots and lots of stairs. I couldn't imagine going up those stairs on a day as hot as that one. If you plan on going up that way, be prepared by making sure you are healthy and staying hydrated. Also, take your time. Overall we had a great time at this completely free attraction. I would love to return on a cooler day and explore the park some more and also return at night for some amazing nighttime skyline photos.

I think the park can use a few more signs for those not familiar to help us navigate.

68,"I highly recommend going up to Mont Royale if you visit Montreal. You can skate, inner tube, snow shoe, cross country ski, or just plain walk (bring snow pants and waterproof boots). ""Inaugurated in 1876, the Mount Royal Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the highly skilled designer behind New York's Central Park. (His sons helped design Grant Park in Chicago). It is an ideal site for admiring a wide variety of plants and birds or for enjoying outdoor activities. Les amis de la montagne offer a variety of services and activities that provide wonderful opportunities to discover the beauty and wealth of resources that the park has to offer, including the new permanent exhibition at the Maison Smith and interactive terminals and map.  Take Bus 11 up the mountain and get off after at Maison Smith and make your way to the pavillion by the lake. You can rent inner tubes, skates, snowshoes, and I think cross-country skis there.My friend and I rented snowshoes for an hour ($9CAD) and walked around the trail. You can store all your things in a wooden bin (they rent out locks), or if you don't mind lugging your things around, I would suggest using a backpack.  There's a trail that leads to the Chateau, and you'll have an amazing view of Montreal and its surrounding areas. If you get cold, you can go into the Chateau and warm up near the fireplace, or just rest in one of the wooden Adirondack chairs and get a refreshment (hot or cold) from the vending machines.It's really a great place for families and an awesome way to enjoy the great outdoors.* tourisme-montreal.org/Wh…lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/lea…",5,1/30/2017,Katherine L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=uPwho6wEsI3b9huaI8y1Iw,"Evanston, IL",Parc du Mont-Royal
69,"What an absolutely stunnnig place to spend a day walking around, experiencing the beauty of a created park and lake right next to an expansive walking trail system overlooking the beautiful city of Montréal. If you don't do anything else, and are on a tight schedule, this is a must do. You can rent bikes if you want to ride around the trails. People walking should be aware that cyclists are on the move. We were lapped a couple times on the trails by a big riding group, who rang a bell upon approach (per Park rules, and common sense). Unlike the solo rider cruising around Lac aux Castors; he didn't announce himself and nearly ended up in the lake for his carelessness when he practically rode into some ladies who didn't hear him. Ample parking at main park (pay at the ticket dispenser) and a smaller lot offside of the road at the summit overlook. Get out at the latter and climb even higher to reach the Mont Royal Cross, which is illuminated at night. Ladies, dressy strappy heels are not recommended on those dirt pathways. Yup, saw it with our own eyes. And please don't feed the wildlife. Recreational smokers tried to look inconspicuous. Something was a giveaway. LOLThe main park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, the Connecticut-born landscape architect and anti-slavery activist, who also designed New York's Central Park. Lac aux Castors was the creation of Frederick Gage Todd, originally from Concord, NH and did his apprenticeship in landscape architecture with Olmsted's firm. There is currently an informative exposition, ""Mont Royal: A Territory to Discover"" in Maison Smith, a 19th century farmhouse. We didn't check out the Maison Smith café. Upper level can be rented out for meeting space. Year-round activities abound in the park for individuals, kids, families and groups (lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/act…).

I decided on stopping by here first. Navigation sent me up the hill into a pay lot. After paying the parking, I was directed to the scenic overlook by friendly locals. A quick five minute walk led me to an overlook that portrayed the Montreal skyline beautifully. The view was spectacular (check pics). There is also a building which I assume can be used as a party hall. And who wouldn't want to have a party with such a view in the distance?The rest of the park includes trails leading in and out of the heavily wooded area.

73,"My very first stop in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, invited for a hike with friends to the gazebo (or what do you call the sightseeing paid-binocular-zoom tour area where we all take selfies) at the top. I had only been there about 12 hours and our first trip was to the famed  ""The Mountain"" like other University students (well I did not enroll yet, that came second).Like Lexington Market (from the state Maryland I was born), just the stores do not sell beautiful, exquisite, intricately designed knives, for style, at every store, instead they've installed trees (the green kind with leaves) versus Lexington Market removed all signs of nature, for style.Same in terms of 420 smoking at any hour night or day somebody has a lighter you can hear, literally hear. Either that or you will hear unequivocal coughing. Be prepared to be offered and propositioned to smoke, exactly like Lexington Market again. So just say no if you need to if you're encountering that, they're used to the certain majority of people who say yes actually.I think a good/fair comparison between Lexington Market and The Mountain is to be made just in terms of: (a) seating made for humans and (b) actual organic nature (to avoid mentioning (c) the store comparisons where only there has weapons, while both have equal hospitals, only there has knives at all stores at the front for quick buying). Montreal Quebec believes it has people there, Baltimore Maryland did not codify that yet.Otherwise has same share of people who are broke and not broke just very amazingly quizical and puzzling difference from how people are treated by default. (Default is a computer word, many people bring their computers to study at The Mountain, versus in Lexington Market you might get told by a security guard to move because you look too good, at The Mountain the police sit the same style as people around during en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta… Tam Tams).",5,10/25/2018,Prosody--Gabriel C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TGeQV83Uo4VFEzPuxJ_Uaw,"Baltimore, MD",Parc du Mont-Royal

76,"As a New Yorker, no walk is too long, and no hike is too high and Mont-Royal was a wonderful day trip to the top. We did not take the marked trail or the path of steps which most people tend to take. Although we did take an off-beaten path (and cough, maybe hopped an illegal fence or two), it was beautifully serene and is a wilderness escape in the middle of the bustling city. I cannot say enough great things about this park, there are many great things to discover, and greenery to immerse oneself in. This park was probably one of my favorite part about Montreal, so if you are an out-of-towner, DON'T MISS IT! I believe there are buses you can take up to the Chateau and you can rent bikes as well, or if you're a little adventurous like us, take the hike up or the off-the-beaten path (I shouldn't condone illegal fences, my bad).  The best part: DON'T MISS THE VIEW FROM THE CHATEAU!A few cons: 1. Very little/no English signage, not all of us know French, especially since it is such a tourist attraction.2. Limited drinks & food at the top, only vending machines.3. Bugs/mosquitoes galore. BRING REPELLANT. I walked away with approx. 37 bug bites, not exaggerating. Remember: To bring snacks (unless you want to get skinny on your hike)To bring drinks/water (unless you are a human cactus)To bring your sneakers (unless you can hike in flip-flops like me)To bring bug spray (unless you want to get eaten alive)To bring a camera (amazing views galore)",5,7/14/2014,Priyanka R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ub1AgBJRK71EZU14f4AaBQ,"Chicago, IL",Parc du Mont-Royal

I think the best time to visit this place is the fall because the trees will be different colors and it will really make the city view beautiful! The small hike up also would not be that slippery from ice/snow. Parking was not bad at all. It was definitely full but you can get parking if you wait a couple minutes.

86,"Very easy to get to with nice views of the city. There are a few ways to get there -- if you have your own car you can drive to the parking lot that is on Chemin Remembrance. You could be adventurous and bike up this same road to the top but that is a major climb. You can also hike fairly easily to the top -- we went through the Cemetery from the North Entrance as we were staying behind Mont Royal in Outremont. The initial part of this path was a bit steep but nothing too intense for an average person. For some reason I kind of expected a grassy area where you could relax and even have a picnic if you wanted at the top but it is not like that at all. There is a strange cottage building (the Chalet) that looks like a train station inside but had nothing except access to bathrooms and a small gift shop (with some cool shirts actually). Otherwise it is just a bunch of different walking trails and then the main attraction is the big open square area for viewing the city with some steps that you can sit on. Make sure you get to the chalet though! There is a small stop area off the road that has views of the city before you walk to the top and I wonder if some people think that is THE view -- it is not. You can also continue walking further up to the cross (Croix) but don't expect much when you get there.Anyway, overall it's a must-see in Montreal in my opinion but also a nice way to start your morning with some activity!",5,5/22/2016,Neechi M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jyGzKoSIs-AStRX3NItM0Q,"Oakland, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

Does have history so read up if your into it:)!Mount Royal is a mid size volcanic hill adjacent to downtown Montreal. We decided to walk from St Laurent street post lunch from Swartz. Many ways to get there. Our ""trusty"" Map-quest took us via Pin- Street. We ended up on the Stadium side of McGill university. People were friendly along the way leading us to our destination. Option 1: Scenic Route windy paved road for a ""casual"" to ""running path up the hill/mountain - vast trees - small creek- some wildlife ? (We saw a huge raccoon, squirrels and a gofer :). Can take a bike up- be prepared to trek up hill.Option 2: stairs - from intersection Pins/Peel. Goes right up to the View Point. Watch out for those avid fitness junkies ( all positive) that are running up and down pass you.Option 3: Bus 80 or I believe there's an express.Option 4: taxi- expensive but good choice if raining or snowing :).Option 5: unbeaten / unpaved path through the trees. Any way up will also take you back down!Also people are so friendly - all local. I am sure they were thinking why is this one attempting this with a cane! Doable ! Attire: we dressed casually as did the locals. Some wearing flip flops! Be prepared though- it's not a stroll unless u make it one. Benches along the way. Take water and do take some snacks. The beaver ""lake"" small quaint resting spot with man made pool. The Chateau at the top- nice architecture but just a space to rest - mostly everyone is outdoors enjoying the view - taking pics and listening to music. There's a few Popsicle vendors and unfortunately NO cafe - just vending machines. So decided if you want to eat prior it take snacks with you. During winter/early spring when raining or snowing - it wasn't this lively and we got taken to an adjacent smaller view point.

Stroller and powerchair friendly with a slight incline. After we took in the view of downtown Montreal and glimpsed inside the chalet, we rounded a 2-ish km pathway. The easy uphill walk featured the croix du mont royal (cross) and ended at a large antennae (very anticlimatic), before we went back to the the chalet.MAISON SMITHBack around where we parked, we went inside Maison Smith to use their restrooms (located in a cool cavernous basement), checked out their informative exhibits about the park, and munched on some lunch in their cafe.LE STADE SCENIC OVERLOOKOn our way out on Camillien-Houde, we stopped for a few minutes at the parking friendly overlook of Le Stade Olympique.Signage was minimal and rather poor, which is why I recommend researching ahead of time so you're not wandering aimlessly around secondary trails. If you like hanging out in cemeteries (you creepster), we passed by two on our way out. The ony thing I regret is not having enough time to make the trek to Lac au Castors (a reclaimed bog/large picturesque pond with water activities).",4,7/12/2015,Jenny H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1LdXqpTv0bcKQVkQB6Lttg,"San Francisco, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

We walked up Peele Street next to McGill's campus until we arrived at the bottom of the mountain and then made our way up. I would suggest wearing sneakers and workout gear for this hike; you'll work up a sweat climbing the 400 steps of a continuous staircase before arriving at the Chalet. If you have the energy and are able to hike some more you can continue on a dirt path to the right and hike a few paths around in a circle, making your way up to the Cross. After your hiking adventure you can head back down to the Chalet and relax, enjoying the view of the city. There is a bus that can take you up and down as well.

This bus will go up the mountain saving you a very long walk up unless you plan on biking up there. You can still walk around the many trails once you get off the bus stop there that's near a very large parking area. You can head up a trail that will take you to the top of the peak where you will get a very nice panoramic view of Montreal. Walking up and looking around will be less than an hour unless you want to spend more time around the trails. I didn't have that luxury so we just did this part and left even though there was lots more to see.Then once you're done the walk take the bus 11 back down the mountain to St. Laurent Blvd. Get off at that street and walk to 3895 St. Laurent Blvd to Schwartz's for short wait and a great Montreal smoked meat sandwich.

It is about a 5 km walk up till you reach the stairs. The view from the top is amazing - you can see all of the city. All the buildings, all areas, the river. Definitely worth it! Go there on a sunny day, on a snowy day, at sunset or sunrise - every single view is amazing. When you live in Montreal you have to see the mountain in all types of weathers - in sun, snow, fall, spring, colors, rain - every setting is beautiful in its own way.

151,"Frederick Law Olmsted designed Central Park and Prospect Park. He also designed Grand Army Plaza, Fort Tryon, Morningside Park, Eastern Parkway... (heck, he coined the word ""parkway""!) So it was interesting to see an aesthetic I'd considered so ""New York"" pop up on my recent visit to Montreal.Montreal's namesake park is, like all the Olmsted creations I've had the pleasure of experiencing, a peaceful expanse that comes with the profound feeling that you're smack in the middle of a bustling city, but at the same time cleanly sealed off from it.  The park is basically a giant hill filled with gorgeous trees. It's a lot more interesting than any ol' tourist park, because it's an adventure in itself! You have to climb up a zigzag of stairs and mazes of roads and foresty paths to explore it (yay goal-oriented behavior).Hiking up to Mont Royal's entrance on Rue Peel sucks. It's like a 40 degree incline; don't know how the McGill kids stand it. But once you enter the park, that peaceful feeling settles in. The stairs are staggered so it doesn't feel too bad.Reserve 2-3 hours of your day to visit Mont Royal. All the signs on paths inside are useless, so leave yourself some time to get lost. If you're visiting during daytime, the autumn leaves are BEAUTIFUL. If you're visiting close to evening - bring flashlights! There are barely any lights the higher up you go, and absolute darkness follows soon after dusk. We saw several intrepid Montrealers wearing headlights. Note that there isn't anything on the ""summit"" proper - you'll catch several lovely views of Montreal going up, but on the true summit there's nothing but a radio tower, plus a crown of trees obstructing any view outward.For some reason, just below the summit, there's a gigantic lit-up Broadway-esque Christian cross, straight out of a sci-fi-horror film.

152,"I saw a large hill and wanted to climb it. First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is. I saw a group of Canadian guys who dressed with urban fashion sense. They were the closest to me, so I walked up to ask directions to the top of the hill. As I approached the group and made eye contact with the assumed ring leader or head dealer in charge, I made eye contact. He tossed a lighter at me and it landed by my feet. I made a straight line toward him and asked what he was trying to prove. To quote Mobb Deep, he was a shook one. There was one of me and around 4 of them. Odds were against me although I would have put a hurting on at least one of them which would have been more than worth the ass whooping. He figured that I was not concerned with his minor act of intimidation. He tried to speak French. I explained that I am from America and don't speak that language. He goes ""You want weed?"" and I told him I don't need his bogus herb, just directions. He provided them.

The view at the top/the chateau is quite nice and you can go inside to rest and warm up.

155,"Mount Royal was definitely a highlight of my trip to Montreal. It was a relatively easy bike ride from our hotel, and we had no issues finding it. It's a beautiful park, with many trails, open spaces for a nap/picnic, and of course, that amazing view once you reach the top. We opted to take the stairs, but I believe there is at least one other path that will get you there. Now let me warn you, those steps are no joke. NO JOKE. It was the middle of August when we visited, and by the time we made it to the top, I was drenched it sweat. My footwear was also wildly inappropriate for such a hike (I had on Chuck Taylors), and a good running or hiking sneaker would've made the journey much more comfortable, I'm sure. The terrace allows for sweeping, panoramic views of the entire city. It was really beautiful, and made our trek more than worth it. There is a visitor's center where you can sit down for a rest, use the facilities, etc. No air conditioning when we went, so it was still sticky inside. There are also vendors selling drinks and ice cream if you need to replenish your energy stores before the much easier walk down the hill.Mont Royal was recommended as a ""must see"" while in Montreal, and after experiencing it, I would agree.

We went up at dusk using the stairs and pathways that cut up the 'mountain'. This took less than 15min. I was able to do it even though I use a cane and am tired at the end of the day.We would highly recommend taking a flashlight with you for your way in the dark - most hotels will lend one out to you if your cell phone light is insufficient.When we got up to the top we saw many people there, some of whom had driven to same lookout view at the top.There were people there even very late at night so my friend and I (both women) thought it was very safe.I regret that we didn't skip one of the other sights to walk it during the daytime or at sun rise/set when we could see the trees in all their glory.",4,1/1/2016,Geeta S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ykcYfhzoSEAwrjoMr5hctQ,"San Francisco, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

164,Ok so no one tells you that it is a very tiresome hike up those stairs. It's about 30+ flights up. From downtown area I was able to walk up a hill about ten mins to the park entrance. Then it was about another 25 min walk up the stairs. I had no idea or would have worn sneakers and light clothing bc you do get tired and hot very fast. I took multiple breaks on those stairs! However when you get to the top the view is well worth it. There is a terrace area that has gorgeous views of the city. There's also some seating and greenery so you can sit down and people watch. Inside the little house thingy there are bathrooms and souvenir shops. There is a small shop that sells very good lemonade. I wanted water but they don't sell it and the vending machine would've cost me 4$ for a small bottle so I got some lemonades instead for 2$ and it was well worth it. Also I wish they had more signage with where to go. There were no signs until about halfway up the stairs. Luckily I followed some other tourists bc my internet also went out in this area and was ableTo walk in the right direction. Overall a very nice place to spend the afternoon.

171,"Montrealers are very proud of the fact that their major city park, Mont-Royal, was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, the mastermind behind NYC's Central Park. But note that the Canadian park came nearly 25 years later; I'm pretty sure that between those two major commissions, Olmstead had a stroke and forgot everything he knew about park design. If you're used to the whimsies and surprises of Central Park - ponds, glades, fields, forests, fountains, ornamental bridges, and stone-lined footpaths - you'd never recognize the same hand at work here. Instead, Mont-Royal is mainly a series of semi-paved tracks through the woods, with little thought for vistas or variety. If you're a local, this makes for excellent jogging or cross-country skiing (and there are plenty of buff bodies along the trails to prove it). But for tourists on a time budget, the only real reason to climb the ""mountain"" is the excellent view from the broad terrace of Chalet du Mont-Royal.

Upon telling our family that we were going we received advice on which sights were must sees and which could be avoided. This was on the must see list.    After walking around the city and meeting some awesome locals we ended up staying up all night drinking in our rental. Our newly made pal left around sunrise and my hubs and I weren't quite ready to hit the hay, so we grabbed a bagel from the shop down the block to help sober us up. After our bagel we decided to talk a walk to the park. Camera in hand we set off. We walked from our rental stopping for another cup of coffee on the way.     We got to the park and expected it to be a breeze to get to the top. I could not have been more wrong, especially after drinking all night. Anyhow, we hiked to the top, and let me tell you it was totally worth the trek. I did get a lot of interesting looks going up the mountain in jeans, with my camera and a cup of coffee.    Once at the top, we were rewarded with sweeping views of the city. This is the perfect place to capture some of the best panoramas of the city below.

Someone was extremely nice and gave us their parking pass. This started out our time at Mount Royal on a great note. We walked for about an hour in the area that has a pretty little lake.

180,"Mont-Royal park is one of my happy places. Rain or shine, hot and muggy weather or below zero temps, you'll find me going for a walk on the mountain. Out of town visitors will ask what the draw is .... it is the mountain itself. No gimmicks, just lots of nature, a few lookouts and Beaver lake. Us Montrealers are extremely lucky to have such a large green space in the middle of the city, ""the lungs of the city"" as Olmsted referred to his parks. My favourite thing to do is put on sturdy hiking shoes, fill up my water bottle and grab a snack, and head out on a couple of hours of wandering. I much prefer the smaller paths to the main Olmsted Road, wiggling my way across the mountain, occasionally popping out in more populated areas like the belvedere and Beaver lake.  The views are beautiful, and I get a thrill finding my apartment nestled in amongst the other buildings.In the winter the smaller paths can be quite treacherous, but the larger ones remain quite nice thanks to the many people who walk, run, job and bike them year round, plus all of those who cross-country ski and snowshoe.  The refrigerated rink at Beaver Lake is great, as it doesn't matter what the weather is like, the ice is always nice.",5,10/16/2013,Amanda C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
181,"This park is huge -- it's Montréal's equivalent of Central Park in NYC or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.  There are massive open spaces and wide, groomed-dirt trails for people to walk, bike, or jog.  If you take the trails all the way up to the top, there's a huge empty building that looks like it could host giant receptions and galas, with a large patio with a great view of the city.There's a giant pond with paddleboats in the summer, and ice skating in the winter!  Plenty of picnic areas, too.  It's definitely a great spot to check out if you are in Montréal.  Especially since the park is FREE!  (parking costs money, though).OHMIGOD - I just realized that the entire city of Montréal is named after this place!!",5,8/26/2011,Chris Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QKhJkTpDuwnR6TozGT1eqg,"Newark, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal
182,"I was pretty much told that we were going to Parc du Mont-Royal by my boyfriend while we were in Montreal. I had no desire to go since I thought it was just a hill.Driving up to the park, it was pretty scenic with trees, bicyclists just everywhere. More than half way up, there was an overlook where you can see the buildings of downtown Montreal. I thought it was so neat I wanted to stop and take a look, but we kept driving up even further.Holy. Cow. The view left me breathless. So amazing seeing the whole city from this one point.  I am so glad I was able to experience this on my trip to Montreal.Very neat place. Can be very romantic if there weren't many people around. There was a visitor who was playing this random piano that was just placed there.",5,9/6/2013,Bunny P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EA8GylDs_8kpvbkrRppcgQ,"Orlando, FL",Parc du Mont-Royal
183,"Wonderful!  So refreshing to get out & into nature in the middle of the city.  We loved the walk on the trails and barely saw any other people--so quiet & peaceful.  Our kids' feet got chilly, so it was nice to warm up by the fire at the chalet.  This nice public space was also a good place to use the restrooms and take photos of both the building and the view.  Their gift shop was straightforward and very well-curated.I'd love to explore this area more in the summer; it's probably so pretty.",5,4/13/2015,Danielle B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o1-Flue1EoUvRsOR9cDRsA,"Medford Lakes, NJ",Parc du Mont-Royal

185,"Pros: View of Montreal and outskirts, nice park before getting to look offCons: Paying for parkingSeeing this was our first trip to Montreal we decided to see it all from a distance. If you're looking at getting a birds eye view of downtown Montreal (for free/cheap) this is the way to do it. There is a lot of parking, however be prepared to dish out a few bucks for it. There are several pay stations where you pay for a certain amount of time and put the receipt on your dash.You first come to the park. There seem to be an assortment of trails you can take, although we hardly explored any. There are several sculptures and pond in the park, in addition to a lodge style building - it was closed since we arrived early in the morning, so I'm not sure its function.There were signs to lead you to the view point, but we didn't see anything that directed us from the parking lot, so keep that in mind - you may need to walk around a bit if you're unfamiliar with the park layout. Once you get to the top you will be pleased with the view. Its an incredible sight to see all of Montreal from one spot. You can see the entire city, the river and a few smaller mountains in the background (looking towards Vermont). I would say this is a great spot to visit when going to Montreal. I gave it a ""average score"" because it was just that. It wasn't terrible - I would say still visit, but don't plan to be ""wow'd"" by any means.",3,8/14/2014,Josh B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pnr3WpOif1r75BN5xept3A,"Halifax, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
186,"Absolutely awesome!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they could use some food and beverage vendors at the chalets and, also, they could use a pay app that had gps for all of there different trails. Tourists for sure would purchase since we, and others we encountered, were lost and google maps didn't help. If you knew where you were going and you could track your distance (for training purposes) this park would be better than central park, NY. It definitely has the potential; I hope the next time we visit there are improvements.

187,The place is nice. We went during the winter so it was underwhelming and not paved at all (must bring snow shows) but once you get to the top the view is very nice and the satisfaction of having climbed the mountain is wonderful. Don't expect a paved and nice easy walk if it's winter/snow is outside. Im not complaining though I liked the rugged trip.

188,"How can anybody give this gorgeous urban oasis, the Grand Dame of Montreal, less than a 5-star rating???? It's incomprehensible to me!!!As a kids, my grandparents came to this park, centrally located in the heart of the city, yet feeling worlds away from the hustle and bustle of city life. My father grew up near here and visited the mountain here a gazillion times. As a child, I was taken here every winter to skate on Beaver Lake (which was iced over each winter) and us kids tobogganed down the gentle slopes by the Lac des Castors, stopping only for hot cocoa we got in the adjacent chalet. As a teenager and young adult, I spent whole summers here, suntanning on the slopes with my friends, having picnics, playing our guitars, tossing frisbee and listening to the radio (yes, we were frustrated hippies! Lol). The hilly slopes were packed with fellow sunbathers and families and couples, just relaxing and taking in the warm weather and the gorgeous surrounding greenery. I hear the mountain is still bustling in the summer!The lower mountain contains Beaver Lake, the large chalet and miles and miles of pathways and trails, paved and not, big and small. There are a gazillion squirrels and ducks (and there used to be swans, too, but I haven't seen them the last few times I visited). There's a playground/park area off the lake that has been renovated and updated sometime in the past 5 years or so. It's amazing! There are 2 climbing rocks and a small ground-mounted water feature and lots of contemporary play equipment. Even my two teen kids loved these new playground features! And I loved seeing all the young tots and families laughing and playing; there were French and English families, orthodox Jewish families, and I heard other languages spoken that I could not place. It was great. Everything a city park should be.The upper mountain (which is connected to the lower mountain by way of a gazillion paths and trails) is comprised of a grand stone chalet (I think it's called the Smith House) and the most popular lookout of the entire city, with a vista of McGill and the downtown skyline. You know the photo of downtown Montreal you see on 90% of postcards? That's taken at this observation lookout. It's a spectacular view, day or night. Further up the mountain, on trails and paths, big and small, are a tall,  on-descript radio or cell tower, a radio CBC building, and then the piece du resistance, the glorious cross of Montreal (croix de Mont Royal). I laughed when I read the reviewer say that the cross was creepy and she didn't know why it was there. In 1643, the founder of Montreal, de Maisonneuve, erected the first cross on this site. As long as I can remember, and as long as my father can remember, there's always been a cross here on the mountain, which is illuminated each night. I remember studying late in the McGill library in the early 80's and seeing the cross light up at night. It's not creepy; it's an integral part of the City's history.Anyhow, Mont Royal is a glorious oasis. It's beloved by bikers, jogger's, strollers, dog walkers (man, I used to walk my dog Maggie here a lot in the 90s! She adored  exploring all the narrow trails through the woods), families and ALL Montrealers. Interns and doctors on break come here from the Montreal General for a brief respite, to de-stress. Mommy groups come here. Couples snuggle on benches. The young and old come here. This is our Central Park - and, I know I'm biased, but I prefer it to Central Park, as the views of the city cannot be beat. And it's safe. And clean.  The mountain is stunning in fall, with the explosion of colors in the foliage. It's serenely beautiful in the winter with the glistening snow and ice-crystalled trees. It's fresh and crisp in the spring with the scents of grass and the colors of flowers emerging. And the greenery of summer and the warmth of the air is wonderful. My only gripe is the parking. It used to be free. Now they've revamped the lots, so there seems to be way more parking spots (always a good thing!), but it costs so much to park ($3/hour), even when the park is near empty on cool and rainy days. I remember spending whole days here, with my pals in the summer, and it cost nothing. I think the park was more frequented and enjoyed then.",5,8/16/2013,Nancy H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NDhDMKqSiBc0L06jKlFnmg,"Vancouver, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
189,My wife and I and two friends drove up to Montreal for a quick 3 day vacation before moving onto Quebec City. We stayed at an Airbnb place near Mount Royal so we had to check it out.

192,I have been coming here my whole life and absolutely love this place.  I think the lookout is one of my favourite spots in Montreal with its views of the downtown skyline.  On a beautiful day it is a great spot to enjoy a picnic or go for a run.  Even in winter it is worth coming to if you like skating or cross country skiing.,5,9/8/2013,Julia D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UDFIZXP0kOb2xKoYToTS6w,"Montreal, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
193,"If you want the easiest way to get up Mont Royal, get on Peel Street. There's a LOT of stairs to the top. There's several walking paths in which people are usually exercising. There's some statues on the ground level. Once you get to the top, there is an ice pop cart off to the right(I think). There's a large area where you can take pictures, but the only place you can sit outside is right in front of the building, and if it's sunny, the sun will definitely be on you. Inside, there are interesting squirrels in the eaves. There is a gift shop and some seating. There's a vending machine, but if you want plain water, you have to go downstairs, where there are restrooms. It's generally creepy in the basement, though.

195,"In case you're feeling a little adventurous, I just want to mention something that may not have been mentioned in previous reviews. Once you reach the Chalet du Mont Royal with the large circular viewing area where all the tourists linger around and take photos, that's not the highest you can go. If you're facing the Chalet, keep walking behind it up some stairs and you'll see a park. Instead of going around the park along the paved road, cut straight to back of the park and you'll see some unpaved entry way into what looks like a hiking trail. Keep walking and you'll find yourself in a forest. I stumbled upon it by accident because I didn't want to walk along the pavement and was so glad I did. The locals must all know about it because I saw a couple of people jogging in there with their dogs, but it's a heavenly area to be in if you want to take the road less taken. See pic: yelp.ca/biz_photos/BYnmP….Once you enter the trail, it'll take you only 15-20 minutes to get to the top. You also have several chances to cut out of the trail and return to the paved road if you want. I may be wrong but once I reached the top, there was no view, but the trail itself is worth checking out.",5,9/18/2011,Cathy Z.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0TEhMp517b3hO54B3yor9A,"Portland, OR",Parc du Mont-Royal

Mont-Royal has one of the best running paths I've ever been on, and you'll see your fair share of runners on any given day. If for whatever reason you can't hike or run up, there's also a road (and bus) in the back that you can use to drive up to the vista points. If you're lucky enough to be in Montreal throughout the seasons, you'll be able to catch the astonishing annual lifecycle of the mountain from here - from the budding greens of spring, to the overflowing life in summer, to the fiery leafs of fall, to the snowy calm of winter.

The terrain is gravel and it's quite shady. The way to the top is by long switchbacks up the mountain and then a long set of stairs to the top. Once you reach the top, you're rewarded with a view of Montreal (on a clear day) and there's plenty of steps and chairs to sit and rest.For our way down, we saw a short cut which basically when straight down the mountain via steps.

Except for the red ""s"" that is so prominent from almost every viewpoint (see pics). Really though, it's a winter wonderland.Super fun to slip and slide down the closed staircases. I'm pretty sure the whole park would be closed in the US for fear of crazy lawsuits. Props to Canada for keeping it open and trusting people to use decent judgment.

218,"Mont royal is a lovely park right in the middle of Montreal.  My boyfriend and I went in early July and the weather was perfect.   When you're at the top, you can see the whole city.  But the good part (for me) was the walking up to the top - not so much the view!  Before we went, we read a lot of reviews about the hike and how it would take hours to walk it, that  the stairs are horrible and to take the bus etc.  After having done it, I can honestly say that IT""S NOT THAT BAD!  We started at Stanley Ave (I think - one of the streets by McGill) and Pine.  We walked along the path and looped it up.  We weren't walking fast and it took us about 40 minutes to get to the summit.  We're also not speed walkers or in great shape.  It was just a leisurely pace. We took the stairs down and once we realized how short they were, we actually went back up on the stairs!  It took like 10 minutes and that was just going an average pace!  Seriously - THE STAIRS ARE NOT THAT BAD!!!Hope this helps to put others at ease!  Wendy",4,8/21/2012,Wendy Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ALY9ndNxWej1m21X6TuPvg,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal

I went back a couple days later and hiked up on my own! I went via Station Mont Royal - stopping off at the cute boutiques/coffee shops along Avenue du Mont Royal. That area is definitely a lot more rustic and interesting compared to downtown. It was soooo beautiful - very easy road/track to walk up - with more challenging vertical climbs if you wish to do so - and as I was there in Autumn, the beautiful colors of the leaves accompanied you the whole way, until you get to the top and see the stunning view overlooking Montreal! Things are clearly signposted and its worth checking out the Chateaux - where the old groundskeeper used to live - and in the basement (where the free toilets are!) is an interesting display of the history etc of the area. Didn't have any food at the Chateaux, but there were plenty of people eating and enjoying a hot drink. The walk down via the steps back into downtown is a nice way to take a look through McGill University too.

240,"A hike up to the top of Mont Royal is an experience not to be missed if you're ever in Montreal.  It doesn't take too long, but I would recommend leaving enough time to take a stroll around and take in the beautiful scenery.  I was able to climb up the stairs (this is the shortcut) in about an hour - starting from the bottom of the street (corner of Peel and Maisonneuve).  I stopped a lot along the way, as I wasn't feeling too well that day, so it's probably hike-able in less than an hour if you're full of energy that day. :)  The final 100 steps or so are quite steep and nearly a vertical trek up, so it's something to keep in mind.If you choose to take the leisurely route and stop through other historical spots, it is supposed to take about three hours.  It's also allegedly a lot less steep, as the incline is gradual.  I highly recommend checking out Frommers' ""Walking Tour 3 or 4"", which is a detailed self-guided tour through and up Mont Royal.Once you reach the top of the stairs, you'll be at the Chalet du Mont Royal.  It's a breathtaking view of the entire city, and I was lucky to be there on a sunny, but cool day.  Even though it was the tail end of summer, the late afternoon breeze up there was quite chilly for an LA native such as myself!  You can continue past the Chalet, through a gravel-ish road that will lead you to the Croix (the cross atop the mountain).  It takes about 10-15 minutes to get there from the Chalet, but it's a lovely walk through a visual of greenery that is so worth it.  Location is easy to get to, as the uphill trek starts in downtown area (very close to McGill University and the Peel or McGill metro stops).  Do it!",5,9/29/2011,Sara R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0tf14Cq5NU3PBINpEDXZdQ,"Dallas, TX",Parc du Mont-Royal

It involved a lot of walking uphill, walking over some tiny streams (that were still running), walking up some steep rocky bits and some flights of stairs, slipping sometimes, but it was worth it. The view from the top is incredible, you can see much of the city. I went during the nighttime, so I could see all the buildings lit up and could point out some landmarks, such as te Olympic Stadium. The way up may have been more difficult, but the walk back down proved to be much easier. I returned again this spring, and it was a much different experience. It was raining and foggy, but wasn't too chilly or anything. My group took a different route this time. In the winter we had walked up some roads, but this time all we did was take some stairs to walk up (which were the same stairs I took on the way back down during my trek in the winter). Walking up the stairs was lengthy, but again well worth it. Because it was foggy you couldn't see too much of the city, but it was beautiful seeing the rain fall from that high up.If you love nature like myself, it's a pretty amazing hike to take, being surrounded by the trees.

You can take the stairs up as well, which happened to be opened even during the winter season.  There was a building there beside Beaver Lake where you can rent skis & skates for a small price. Beaver Lake was frozen and many people were ice-skating on it. Kids were enjoying their time tobogganing and many others were having a great time skiing.Up on the mountain, there is a boutique and small cafe in the Smith House. The boutique was nothing special; it was like a store you would find at the zoo. Also, on the top of the mountain you have a breathtaking view of the city below- worth seeing!",5,1/26/2011,Masha B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sMhvlIPGLUlRA7QsWlqBOg,"Toronto, Canada",Parc du Mont-Royal
262,"I have such great memories from this park.  I spent a good part of my youth in Montreal and sadly do not live there now, but try to get up there as often as possible.  My grandparents took me there tobogganing, I went there with friends to hang out and explore.  It is a magical part of Montreal -- from its peak to its base.This is such a wonderful -- and huge (101 hectare or nearly 250 acres) -- park with so much to see and do.  Everything from hiking, biking, skating, skiing, etc.  I have climbed up the mountain and walked all along its trails and never get bored of it.And don't forget about the views from the parking area at the top of the peak -- the BEST views of this wonderful city are here night and day.  You can also start a small hike from here to the lighted cross at the top of the moutain.Oh . . . and for those of you with religous or historical curiousity, there is also the 100+ year old St. Joseph's Oratory where supposedly 1,000's were healed there throughout the years.  There are thousands on crutches on display which are supposed to have come from those who were healed there.  Very moving place to visit -- even if you are not Catholic.  (and shhhhh . . . don't tell anyone, but my cousin and I used to shoot off caps from the top balcony overlooking the parking area.)  And it is gorgeous to look at in the evening when it is all lit up -- I used to love standing in our living room window before going to bed and seeing that lovely church all lit up -- especially in the winter time.To sum it up, there is SO much to do in this oasis of a park which is in the heart of the city.  Montreal would not be the city that is without the beauty of this park.  So no matter what time of year you are there visiting -- or if you are lucky enough to be living there -- don't overlook Mount Royal, as there is something to see and do everywhere you turn.  Or if you don't want to do anything at all, there is so much open space to just sit and relax.There is always something going on there -- much like Central Park in NY -- to check out the happenings at Mount Royal, check them here: lemontroyal.qc.ca/index2…",5,8/8/2008,Jeffrey K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jbOVoVtVXIqnhE_cp-yMnA,"Rockville Centre, NY",Parc du Mont-Royal

264,"Walking up to the lookout point near the top of Mont Royal was a highlight of our trip to Montreal. The park itself is gorgeous, and was designed by Frederick Olmstead, who also designed NYC's Central Park. In September, it was lush, verdant and filled with just enough people to remind us that we weren't in the middle of the forest -- although we did spot a raccoon hiding in a little hole in the top of a tree!After walking on the path for a few miles (oops, kilometers) and noticing we were slowly gaining altitude, we took a staircase up (maybe the equivalent of 5 minutes on a StairMaster) and emerged at the Kondiaronk Belvedere (what a badass name), a lookout point -- not the tippy top of the ""mountain"" but definitely near the summit. From there, we had a great vantage point to take in the whole city, especially the skyline. Fortunately, there was also a chalet open to the public with nice, clean restrooms. It was only a short walk from the chalet to the Smith House, which sells gifts, and more importantly, sorbet.Once we made it back down the stairs and down the hill, we emerged back into the city at the doorstep of the McGill campus, enabling us for more urban exploration (i.e. a lot more walking).",5,10/15/2011,Colleen R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=iNV_dTKaxit6ZkvbRfERdQ,"New Orleans, LA",Parc du Mont-Royal
265,"I went to Montreal over a year before writing this for a week long birthday vacation with my boyfriend. Growing up in the Midwest, United States, I spent most of my life deprived of mountainous regions. Before we even arrived to the city, I was determined to climb my first mountain - Mont Royal. After experiencing a few days of the city, we made the venture from our hotel in Longueuil to the park (after a brief stop for meat pies at Tourtiere Australienne! YUM!!). Never one to follow conventional wisdom, (or previously marked trails, for that matter) I - the trail guide for the day - decided to bush-wack our way up the side of the mountain. About half-way up, without a trail in sight, we realize that we've gotten ourselves into a bit of a situation. Above us was steep, crumbly dirt that was still wet from the rain from the last couple days. Below us was a slightly less steep drop, but jagged rocks, broken glass bottles, the few trees we'd been using to pull ourselves up, and just as much crumbly ground. With no choice at that point but to continue on, we scaled the side of the mountain by digging into the dirt until we finally found a path to continue on to. From the grounds around Chalet du Mont-Royal, you can see the whole city spread out in all of it's glory below you. We arrived just before dusk, so we had the immediate transition from the sunny scenery, to the rosy glow lending its light to the vista below.  We found our way in the quickly departing light to the Croix du Mont-Royal - the peak of the mountain, and while I was busy taking pictures of the cross at night, my boyfriend was rummaging through his bag. I turned around to see what he thought of the view as he was getting down on his knee with a small box in his hand. He asked if I would climb more mountains with him, then he asked me to marry him!  The Parc du Mont-Royal, and its namesake mountain will always hold a special place in my heart, but even if you don't have the same sentimental experience, it's still a great place to see!",5,9/11/2011,Amber D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1tntwPMN42Dx3q_Rpx6vLg,"Wellesley, MA",Parc du Mont-Royal

So many picnics there, so many days lying around eating baguettes and cheese during Tams.

277,"My friend and I took a nice hike up to the lookout in Parc du Mont Royal.  It was a bit confusing because we didn't exactly know where we were going, but we asked for directions and figured it out.  If you start from the main entrance on the east side of the park, you walk up to the main road, take a left onto the road, and follow it up.  There were a lot of shortcuts over the switchbacks but I didn't really want to get lost, so I didn't take any of them.As people have mentioned, the main entrance was filled with drummers (?).  Everyone tries to be hip in Montreal.  The lookout area was nice and there's a building up there and some plaques pointing out the various sights of Montreal.  There's also higher ground at the real summit, but we didn't have time to go there.  On our way back to the main entrance, we encountered a bunch of people dressed in medieval gear, battling each other.  It was pretty cool.  They divided up into two groups.  Someone signaled the beginning of the battle and they charged each other with padded swords and shields.  Typical rules: if you're hit on the arm or leg, it's disabled.  Everyone keeps fighting until one army is completely disabled.  There were some archers, too, but foam tipped arrows didn't seem very effective as they didn't fly far or straight.  I thought it was funny how the 10 year old kids hung at the back of the army and tried to rush in for a few quick flurries.",4,6/10/2009,Terri Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WqeK9gyjDXL_7G3RjIUGHQ,"Los Altos, CA",Parc du Mont-Royal

We took the windy path to the top and skipped the stairs, taking one short cut at one point and beat several pairs we saw along the windy path. However, once we got to the top, we turned, and all we could see were trees and a parking lot. We headed west, and found three paths and a large lake, but never figured out how to get to ""the top"" for the views of the city skyline. Perhaps one should find a map so one know which trails to go. The few signs we saw were all in French and we don't read French too well.  Oh well, it was still lovely to see and we got a decent work out. Lots of people were jogging, bicycling, and a couple were even using walking sticks. We viewed the peace monument. I learned that hiking through nature tends to give me right knee pain. Not sure whether I'm not walking right or what. I should really stop hiking. There are plenty of benches and cute streams to enjoy if you can't go higher up the hill.

It also reminded me a little bit of the parks with hikes embedded into San Francisco. The hike itself up to the top is not particularly difficult but not particularly easy either. Some parts are steep and you'll definitely work up a bit of a sweat. Its totally worth it though, as you'll get the best view possible of Montreal from the top, particularly around sunset. You can do the whole thing in an hour and a half or so if you are in a rush for time. If not, I would suggest bringing a book, some friends and maybe a bottle of wine--  spend an additional hour or two relaxing at the top soaking it all in.

292,"Designed by Frederick Law Olmstead (the same guy who designed NYC's Central Park), this park is located on Mont Royal (the ""mountain"" that gives Montreal its' name).  It's made up of a walking and biking trails that wind their way through trees, a small pond, a chalet and belvedere with awesome views of Montreal's cityscape, a lighted cross that can seen all over the city, the Oratoire St-Joseph (a shrine known for its miracles), and the early city cemeteries.   Probably the most visited place in the park is the chalet and its' belvedere with absolutely the best views of downtown Montreal, the St. Lawrence river valley and the mountains beyond. (If you only have an hour to take in the park, this is the thing to do.)  But I also enjoyed the rest of the park too, particularly the Oratoire and the George-Etienne Cartier monument with its' Tam-Tam drummers. The Oratoire is gorgeous and gives free guided tours but check the website for more information.The park covers about 500 acres, so be prepared to walk everywhere.  There also is the height factor and the top of Mont-Royal is about 700 feet (about 290 m) and the grade is steep.  To go straight up to the chalet, there are stairs from the downtown entrance on rue Peel...a lot of them.  You can take a more leisurely route to the chalet by following the walking paths with its' signs but that route takes much longer.  Luckily, the park signs will direct you everywhere, but it's still nice to have a map of the park or to at least have read up on it.   Don't care to walk the park? You can rent a city bike or you can get a horse-drawn carriage (and in the wintertime, a sleigh) to take you around the park.  There are also a few city buses that stop at the cemeteries.  The buses and carriages cost and there are several carriage companies in different locations to choose from so it's best to check the internet for this. To hoof it on your own two feet, the park is free. It's really nice to bring a picnic lunch to enjoy.  The only bathrooms I found were at the chalet and the only amenities' stand (except for the occasional public drinking fountain) was also at the chalet.  The shortest way to access the park is from the rue Peel Metro Station (if walking) or the Guy-Concordia Metro station (if taking the bus to the cemeteries), but you can also use the Mont-Royal Metro stop to access the northwest corner of the park  (but it's a much longer hike).  I wound my way on foot through the park and saw everything in a little under 4 hours.An absolute must for anyone who likes nature or panoramic views.",5,6/11/2009,Lindsey J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ksQQ8Ff0BgmQ3X7NG3GVhg,"Billings, MT",Parc du Mont-Royal

If you can, rent a paddle boat and enjoy a leisurely ride around Beaver Lake. At $10. CAD for 30 minutes it was a bargain. My daughter loved it. Theres so much to see and enjoy here and it's free.

With so much action and adventure, summer is the best time of year to hang out here. You can picnic, play games or cycle, jog or walk, or just people gaze. It's a bit of a hippy playground which thrives on the tam tam jam culture but this park is just as fun in winter. I've not personally been so far but it's good for winter activities such as snowshoeing, toboganning, et al. Just ideal for those amused by typically Canadian outdoor activities.

We entered the park via the entrance with a billion staircases. I thought I was going to die. But then you get to the top and take in the view, and it's completely worth it. There is a way to access the park without the stairs, but I'm not going to tell you about it because you probably need the exercise if you enjoyed as much of Montreal's fine cuisine as I did. It was a chilly, yet sunny, day when we there, so I can only imagine how the park must come alive in the summer. There was a recreational-type area that was being renovated. There are also two cemeteries that border the park and make for some interesting wandering if you have the time.

Actually, I often forget that there is more to life than eating in general, for that matter). My thought process was, ""Well, I'm only up here for a while and I've got some free time; I should try to make it to the top of that big hill over there."" I went up via the two-lane gravel road off of park avenue, coupled with the massive set of stairs. The quicker way, for the record, I found on the way back, which is to go up the gravel switchbacks off of rue pins right behind the McGill campus. Either way, at the top of the steps, going left and up a further gravel path leads one to the Chalet, with some local vendors and excellent views. The better view, in my opinion, is had by going to the right at the top of the long staircase and then following the path there for a couple hundred yards. There's a small platform with sweeping views to the northeast.I was also interested to see that someone else had alluded to seeing a band shooting a music video up there. When I went up myself (6/27/2011), there was a bigtime video production going on at the top near the chalet, with trucks full of equipment and staff directing people around the filming site.

310,"I went to Montreal a couple of weeks ago for the first time.  I'd always wanted to go and thought I'd like the city and it didn't disappoint.  One of the best parts of the city for me though was Mont-Royal, and I didn't even see half of the park.I actually visited the park twice during my extended weekend stay in the city.  I went up to the park via Rue Peel my first time.  I would recommend heading up to the park this way, or at least heading down this way if you can.  It's great starting from the city and looking up Rue Peel to Mont-Royal.  You also get to walk through the McGill University campus on the way up.  When you reach the park via this route you can immediately access Chemin Olmsted, a walking path that was originally designed as a gravel road for horse-drawn carriages by Fredrick Law Olmsted.  This is the scenic, winding and easy-going way to see the park.  It's great because you're largely surrounded by woods, other paths, and little streams and waterfalls depending on where you are.  However if you're in a hurry and went to get straight to the top, you can take that route as well.  Once you get there you've got the Chalet and a great view downtown, the St. Lawrence and beyond below.  On my second visit to the park during my stay I decided to cut through the park rather than take the metro back to my hotel.  I was in Outremont which is a quite a hike from downtown.  However it was a great hike as I went through the park along Chemin Olmsted.  It was a bit of a dreary and drizzly day, but the park was still beautiful.  There were still bikers, hikers and runners out too.  If I loved in Montreal I'd be in the park a few times week, Winter, Summer, Spring and especially Fall.  Montreal has a real gem in Parc du Mont-Royal and it's one of the highlights of the city.",5,5/16/2011,BLAUGRAN A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8Lsb95PA1neTdCywiQ0_2Q,"Milwaukee, WI",Parc du Mont-Royal

It is very well know, India as country is multicultural as itself (north/south/west/east), and multi religion (Hindu mainly, with Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian).

The are also spaces for practical functions, such as community composting.Encouraging passive recreation is especially important in an area dominated by apartments and flats; enjoying Nature without an activity in mind is just what a crowded downtown area needs lots of. Many things illegal in parks are tolerated. The fragrance of marijuana is commonplace. So are fruit ke bobs, from vendors who are chased out of most  public parks.I would say that if pot is tolerated (as it should be in moderation), the same should go for vending of healthy foods and beverages -- an argument I make in my e-book Food for City Building.Parks such as this are ideal places to support healthy food artisans who enhance the multiple functions of a dynamic urban people park.",4,6/30/2014,Wayne R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kELk-PTS46BdY8vWxnOwRA,"Toronto, Canada",Parc Jeanne-Mance

This park went through some renovations recently and it seems like there is more art, more fountains, more flower beds, and more places to sit, all of which is lovely. The park sits in front of a beautiful Montreal church and is just a short walk from a little strip of cute clothing and houseware shops on St Laurent, and fresh bagels and delicious gelato on Fairmount, so it's a perfect spot for a break from walking around. In the winter there is usually an installation in the middle with Christmas trees for sale, a small stage with live folk music, and a roaring fire.

344,"Terrific park on the eastern side of Nun's Island, with an undeveloped waterfront with wide open views of the South Shore and Champlain Bridge. Not a lot of picnic tables or park benches but everyone who shows up here seems to be well stacked with their own stuff, inflatable kayaks, stand-up paddles, outdoor bbq, volleyball nets, etc. Nun's Island has an extensive network of bike paths but there's also a great hiking trail along the waters edge, in the back yards of the exclusive residences of this wealthy bedroom community, which also intersect at this park. Given how crazy ""mainland"" Verdun has become in the past 3 years especially that dank beach, I'm happy  to find a much quieter, cleaner and natural place where I can watch the birds, read books underneath  the cool shade of willow trees and possibly venture and wade in the water and not have to see a single obnoxious hipster or man-bun in sight.",5,6/12/2021,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc Alphonse Télesphore Lépine
345,"I feel compelled to write a review about this little park immediately. Why would somebody wonder? Because I just listened to Orchestre Métropolitain performing in West Vancouver Park and attempted to check in during a pause between the musical peices. Well, the park didn't even exist in Yelp. Of corse this is no longer the case as I just created it. So one may ask why at Île des Sœurs exists a park with such an unusual name. It appears the city of Verdun is a twin municipality with West Vancouver, therefore the name. I truly hope the municipality of West Vancouver has a park named Verdun. Now about the park. It is accessible via bike path and has a little playground. The best part is the park is at Saint Laurence and you can go to the river through few access points through the threes. There are also few picnic tables near the water. During cold seasons the park offers some breathtaking views of the river, but the local residents really crowd around during the summer and in big numbers. Orchestre Métropolitain performs at West Vancouver park every year during the first weekend of August. Whoever came with the idea to create this amazing event in beautiful surroundings is a genious. The orchestra is outstanding, the concert programme is always oriented towards more popular and easy to listen classical works, the best approach for a diverse public. Considering the fact the talented conductor Yannick Nezet-Séguin is the new musical director of the Met, tonight Ile des Sœur felt like Manhattan of Montreal.

There are even a few spots for fishing and looking at wildlife; like ducks and loons.

350,"A park which pretty much straddles the southern-most shoreline of the island of Montreal, along the eastern parts of Lasalle from Parc des Rapides going into Verdun. I'd say there are three parts to the park. First there's the green space between Lasalle Boulevard and the bike paths. This is where you have a small playground for kids, water fountains, soccer field, the Natatorium (the first public outdoor swimming pool in Canada), the greenhouse, a beach volleyball sandlot, and lots and lots of open green, grassy space interspersed with trees and bushes, which on hot summer days is taken up with families doing BBQs, couples picnicking, people on blankets napping, reading books, doing work on their devices, playing frisbee etc.Second, there is the bike path which runs along the riverside and now a gravel path specifically for pedestrians right alongside the bike path since traffic on the bike path is so busy now with bikers, roller-bladers and runners. Third, there is a hiking trail, below the bike path right along the river's edge and this is my favorite part. It's full of trees, bushes, wild grass and it not manicured at all and runs a little wild in some places. This is where, if you happen to be at the right time and right place, you'll see ducks, Canada geese, owls, muskrats, blue herons, Arctic terns, turtles, grass snakes, a beaver or two, raccoons, foxes, pike jumping out of the water (I've seen all of them),  and on occasion, like this past winter, a bald-head eagle and seal which a local photographer caught on camera. There's also rapids and on clear days, you can see right over to Mont St.Gregoire, Mont St.Bruno and Mont St. Hilaire in the distance. There are also some great quiet spots where you can easily sit down among the large boulders and small grassy knolls and just take in the scenery, meditate and do whatever. While the rest of Montreal obsesses over ""The Mountain"" and crowded Mont-Royal park, I say let them be and come down to ""The River"" instead.",5,5/25/2017,Bobby A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Montreal, Canada",Parc de l’Honorable-George-O’Reilly

354,"My buddy Angela M and I set ourselves a mission of exploring Montreal on our bikes this summer, both to stretch our local horizons and to build up our bike muscles. So on a not-too-hot Saturday end of July we set out from Mile-Ex to Parc Bellerive with the intention of catching a ferry there over to the îles de Boucherville National Parc. The parc itself was bigger and more lovely than we knew, we could have just hung out there. On that particular Saturday there was a festival happening celebrating Mexican culture with food and a big stage with live music. Families spilled out beyond the gates of the festival, picnicking and BBQing in the parc. The park runs along the waterfront, it's wide and breezy and full of trees and water access for splashing with puppy dogs or doing some fishing. There is a cute gazebo near where the ferry docks. The ferry runs every hour on the hour till 5pm in the summer and costs $9 including your return fare. It's perfectly setup for taking bikes over to the islands, we had a great time and can't wait to go back! The parc Bellerive itself is 22 hectares, we didn't explore it all but it looks like a great place to go for a run, or hang out with your family and friends and watch the rushing water of the Fleuve St Laurent.",4,7/27/2015,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Parc de la Promenade Bellerive

The levels of grass allows you to lounge and relax while you take in a little bit of everything around you and if you have a lot of energy, a DJ is set up near the snack bar if you feel like salsa dancing (beware there are some pretty good salsa dancers who come out).

The fountains also provide constant entertainment for kids as well as adults. The eating and drinking and stage part of the park is wheelchair accessible, as several of the patrons enjoying the place were using powered wheel chairs (not just racing chairs that can pop a wheeley to get over small steps). However, the grassy slope area is likely less friendly to wheels. It's a very social and fun environment. There's security in the evening to keep it family friendly, but they are just as customer-service oriented as the bartenders - friendly and calm, just making sure alcohol stays in designated locations and those who get too intoxicated don't disrupt the fun. The Dark & Stormy cocktail was shockingly good, for what is usually a simple cocktail. The sangria tasted very orange-juice-y, and fell a bit flat - I split both drinks with a friend, and we both agreed.

378,"I put up a few photos of Montreal's Parc Olympique, the Olympic Park, and I was prompted to write a review.  I thought I already had.  I had actually reviewed venues within it, such as the Inclined Tower and the Biodome.  The reality is that Parc Olympique features even more than these two venues ... quite a bit more.  First of all, it's a park covering an extensive area in a quadrant of Montreal bounded by four major streets.  Then, in addition to the tower and the Biodome is its centerpiece, the stadium, home of the Montreal Alouettes football team, but also previously home to the Montreal Expos baseball team.    The other thing to note is that there is a Sports Centre (Canadian spelling), which includes the natatorium used in the Olympics when they were hosted here, as well as a gymnasium and even a sports therapy center.  Montreal wasn't going to let these sit as monuments.  Instead, they generate revenue.  The general public can use the Sports Centre to swim and exercise, though I don't know how much that costs.Getting to the Parc Olympique is easy.  It's really the only major attraction quite a ways east of Centre-Ville and the Metro can get you there.  The stations to use are Viau and Pie IX, and they are on the Green Line in the direction of the Honore Beaugrand terminus.  Getting to the Parc Olympique by car is also doable.  One just needs to follow Sherbrooke eastward from Centre-Ville and the 60 story angled tower and stadium will readily announce when you have arrived.  Parking is expensive, and I have found that patience, reading neighborhood parking signs (only in French), and some distance may reward one with a free parking space on the street, based on the times that I have driven to the complex.The thing that is most striking about the complex is how complex it is.  I'm referring to all the curves and swoops built out of reinforced concrete.  It is amazing and awe inspiring.  Hearing of the budget overruns, however, is shocking.  In various visits to the Parc Olympique, I have been to the top of the Inclined Tower twice and to the Biodome once.  At other times, it's just a great place and space to walk around and see the complex, and all the ramps and plazas around it.  Hoodlums on skateboards seems to think so, too.  One of the Metro stations is tucked underneath one corner of the complex, or so it seems.  In terms of pricing, the attractions are predictably in the mid-range, can be grouped into packages of 2 or 3 venues, and the AAA/CAA card can help knock off a few dollars.As for demerits, there are a few.  Be careful when walking on the grass, let alone sitting on the grass.  It's Canada, meaning there are Canadian geese.  Use your imagination.  Also, at times, the complex looks a little desolate and, in some spots, you will encounter graffiti and reinforced concrete that is spalling.  It's a little long in the tooth, so I'm sure it requires a lot of upkeep.Lastly, note that Montreal's botanical garden and insectarium are across the street.  I always sort of shined on the idea of the city's botanical garden, but I eventually learned that it is actually very nice, both in terms of its contents and its tranquility, and worth visiting at least once.  Given that this is 2016, this means it's the 40th anniversary of the Parc Olympique.  It hosted the 1976 Olympics, when Montreal was experiencing rapid growth, the metro area had two major airports, and I'm sure that the complex, looking both avant garde and spic and span at the same time, was quite a sight.  It still is and it's worthy of nothing less than 4 stars.  Every trip to Montreal has included a visit to the Parc Olympique, even if just to look at it, walk around, and take photos.",4,8/23/2016,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",Olympic Park

398,"I tried to imagine Olympic Park as it was when it hosted the 1976 Summer Olympics.  I imagined it to be bustling with activity, filled with athletes and spectators from all over the world who came to participate in an historical sporting event.  In my mind, there was an energy in the air that you could almost touch.  Of course, I wasn't even there, so my assumptions are based exclusively on what I see happening when I watch the Olympics of today; the Michael Phelps era of Olympic history.  Fast forward to 2012, the Phelps era, and a stroll around Olympic Park will make you feel as if you are wandering through a post-apocalyptic wasteland on some far away planet, light years away from its former 1976 Olympic glory.  From what I've read, the construction and planning of Olympic Park was a nightmare before it even started.  Tons of delays, poor budgeting, massive amounts of debt and sub par construction techniques all marred what is actually a pretty awesome looking group of facilities.  As dilapidated as it is, I think it is really cool.  It's futuristic and extremely dated, an eyesore and a masterpiece, historical and irrelevant - a truly fascinating place.  We took a guided tour which brought us to many of the main sites of the park, including Olympic Stadium (former home of the Expos) and the Olympic pool.  I believe the tour lasted just under one hour.  We also went up to the Montreal Tower observation deck for some amazing views.  We skipped the Bio-dome, unfortunately.  We just didn't have time to check it out.  All of the things we did at Olympic Park were worth it, but for me, the best part of it was when I was able to tune out the tour guide and imagine what this place used to be like and how it became what it is today.  I'm just happy that no pieces of concrete collapsed on me in the process.",5,12/1/2012,Nick H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AQA2144dzVsed820TLijKg,"Long Island, NY",Olympic Park

I remember the first and last game of the Expos last season where the entire stadium was sold out. I've also heard of concerts by legendary bands Rolling Stones playing there.

Still you're looking at over 200 acres of land, mostly forest, and hundreds of community garden plots. Here recently for the inspiring and humbling Walk So Kids Can Talk I got a quick ATV tour of the park limits, including the big bordering streets (oh my!) and enjoyed the 5km walk past ponds, sweeping willows, meditative tai chi groups, and the incredibly convenient metro stop that drops you off sweetly right at the park's grassy doorstep. It made me feel glad to live in a city where bits of green space are still cherished by local residents and protected by the powers that be, I hope that remains the case even in the face of economic change and challenges.

If you don't have a bike yourself, you could rent a bike, and even if there's a problem with your own bike, in Ma Bicyclette they repair bikes, or you could pump the wheels if you need it. There's also a few restrooms on the way, and it's just a great way to spend a couple of hours: healthy, pretty view, nice spots to get drinks(i.e. St-Ambroise Terrace for beer, or Rosi Panini for sandwiches) and just beautiful parcs along the way!

458,"Chalet du Mont-Royal or Mount Royal Chalet was the highlight of our visit to Mount Royal Park (Parc du Mont-Royal: yelp.com/biz/parc-du-mon…). I think any visitor to Montreal has to go see it. I'm not sure where else outdoors in Montreal has such beautiful, wide, sweeping views of the city. It's like the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, but with less traffic and people, and better views.Mount Royal Chalet is located on Mount Royal, the small mountain in Montreal the city is named after. We took the long way to the chalet by hiking up the mountain from the west-side entry point at Pine Ave W and Peel St. The quickest and easiest way to get to the chalet is by parking in one of the lots off Remembrance Rd and walking up the Olmsted Trail from there. It's probably about a short 10-minute walk from the lots.The chalet, which opened in 1932, is home to what's called the Belvedere Kondiaronk. It's really the belvedere that's the main attraction here. It's spacious and has quite the overlook. It's large and faces southeast over the city. The vista is breathtaking, day or night. We came at sunset.The chalet itself, which is open daily 8am-8pm, offers Wi-Fi, food and drink, a gift shop, restrooms, and an information desk.If you're visiting Montreal and have never been to the Mount Royal Chalet, I definitely recommend checking it out. The small walk/hike is worth it.",5,2/9/2020,Daniel B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg,"Atlanta, GA",Chalet du Mont-Royal

When you get to the top you can hang out and check out the views for as long as you like. There is also a small gift shop at the top. In the bottom part of the building there is an interesting exhibit about the Montreal Olympics and the use of the stadium in the years since.

525,"I'm going to go with 4 stars.  It's great, but it can't compete one on one with the grandeur of Toronto's CN Tower.  The unique feature about the Inclined Tower at the Olympic Stadium of '76 is that it is the tallest free standing and most inclined concrete structure in the world.  And that sort of feat, in the 70s, was most likely to make for some severe budget overruns ... and it reportedly did.Set on the grounds of the Olympic Stadium and adjacent structures such as the aquatic center and an exhibit of different bio-systems with representative animal life, the site is captivating for the extensive sculpting of these buildings and for the stark eery feeling of these shapes set against these vast open concrete plazas around the Olympic complex.  They are impressive, though they are starting to look dated and there is epoxy that should be applied here and there.  I'm sure the facility management team has their hands full.  The Expos used to play in the stadium below the Inclined Tower and cables from the tower hold up the stadium's roof cover.I really recommend going up on the Inclined Tower to its observatory if you haven't been.  The Metro exits are Viau or Pie IX.  One goes to the rear of the incline and will see a 2-story elevator that makes the sloped ascent.  The height is about 60 stories.  The price is ok and AAA/CAA helps a little.  Now, compared to the CN Tower, the perimeter up top for viewing the city is slightly constrained, though it has a good angle and a good view.  From the tower, you can see Centre-Ville, Sherbrooke St. connecting the center to the Olympic complex, the South Shore, Ile Ste-Helene in the middle of the river, all the major bridges including the Jacques Cartier, the hill of Parc Mont-Royal, and more.  It really gives one an appreciation for Montreal's spectacular island setting.",4,5/3/2013,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",The Montréal Tower

Because I just listened to Orchestre Métropolitain performing in West Vancouver Park and attempted to check in during a pause between the musical peices. Well, the park didn't even exist in Yelp. Of corse this is no longer the case as I just created it. So one may ask why at Île des Sœurs exists a park with such an unusual name. It appears the city of Verdun is a twin municipality with West Vancouver, therefore the name. I truly hope the municipality of West Vancouver has a park named Verdun. Now about the park. It is accessible via bike path and has a little playground. The best part is the park is at Saint Laurence and you can go to the river through few access points through the threes. There are also few picnic tables near the water. During cold seasons the park offers some breathtaking views of the river, but the local residents really crowd around during the summer and in big numbers. Orchestre Métropolitain performs at West Vancouver park every year during the first weekend of August. Whoever came with the idea to create this amazing event in beautiful surroundings is a genious. The orchestra is outstanding, the concert programme is always oriented towards more popular and easy to listen classical works, the best approach for a diverse public. Considering the fact the talented conductor Yannick Nezet-Séguin is the new musical director of the Met, tonight Ile des Sœur felt like Manhattan of Montreal.

553,"This one sure gets my vote, nicest pool in mtl, and the wading pool is pretty cool as well (if you happen to be 3 ft tall or still have one of those 2-3 yrs old bambino). Thumbs up to the administration for not having those annoying rules and regulations seen in other public pools in mtl (dark wink for the Park Decelles pool in Ville St-Laurent). Actually, can someone explain why in the Park Decelles pool a 7 yrs old kid can't use the pool springboard while there is no age regulation in other Montreal public pools? Are there sharks in the Decelles pool and we don't know about it? Anyway, back to the Laurier pool, pretty nice, has this wooden beach, there are places with shadow from trees so even though you like Red Lobster, you don't need to look like one at the end of the day, lots of showers, and a nicely confusing changing room - this shouldn't be the first time when I unwillingly get into the ladies changing room, sometimes I wonder if it's made so confusing on a purpose. Actually, one weird ( and even up to creepy) thing is that there are toilets in the family changing room, so your kids can freely enjoy and pull one of those hard to find the proper answer observations, about this guy taking a - put he's choice here - in the short height door toilet, such as dad, I just saw his underwear on the floor between his legs, yuk.  (Mooment of silence). Anyway, besides the confusion with the changing rooms, and the absence of a dining tables area inside the pool, this is a very nice place to go. The pool itself it's not too crowded, staff it's polite and cool, cheap entrance fees (can someone hire the managers of the pool for the Montreal's parking fees and tickets please? For once those guys know how to find a reasonable fee without making us feel some sort of a financial molesting like when parking a car in the Sainte-Hélène so called 'public' park area at 16$ for the day.  Oh, and on a nicer ending note, whats up with the young and restless watchers PACKED close to the springboard jumping area?

This park has everything you'd want in a park, and more: a fountain and kiddie playground equipment? Check. Many elegant benches by stately trees? Check. A small man-made ""creek"" and larger grassy areas for kids to run around and play, or for picnics? Check. Meandering paths to walk, and an abundance of birds and squirrels to observe? Check!What makes this park of particular significance (other than its location and longstanding history) is the wealth of resources here: the elegant, old Westmount Library is located on the park's western side, as is its connected, gorgeous Victorian glass greenhouse. On the far south edge of the park by St. Catherine are the tennis courts and Westmount pools and indoor ice skating and hockey rinks (note: a new Westmount sport center is presently under construction, so there is a lot of building going on right now. But this sporting center, according to the plans and pictures I've seen, looks like it it's going to be pretty darn amazing, with a children's pool in addition to a lap pool, and other modern amenities).  There might be a new doggie are to the park, too, once all the construction is done. I like seeing all the kids in the park, and many summer day camps bring their young campers here to play.

569,"This place has some really beautiful scenic views of Montréal from up on high on the Mountain. But ... Roman Catholicism is a death cult that condones pedophilia. The Roman Catholic Church is known to condone pedophilia by protecting priests who rape and abuse children, and commit other acts of child sexual assault. The Church does not report these priests to authorities, instead they actively conceal their criminal actions by transferring the pedophile priest to another parish or congregation. In many circumstances the Church will protect and even enable pedophile priests by pressuring survivors of childhood rape and childhood sexual assault to reach a legal settlement which also precludes survivors from speaking out about their trauma. These non-disclosure agreements serve to protect pedophile priests from the criminal justice system. There is also a creepy ritual cannibalism aspect to their worship practices. The Roman Catholic Church is an extremely patriarchal and problematic institution which practices extreme sexism; women are not allowed to participate equally with men, women are barred from the clergy, and are barred from holding any positions of power or influence within the organisation. The Roman Catholic Church is an extremely corrupt, wealthy, and powerful institution; it wields influence like a weapon and inherently acts as an organised crime syndicate. The Roman Catholic Church also failed to speak out against the Holocaust and continues to be silent about the role it played as Nazi collaborator. The Roman Catholic Church also obscures and obfuscates it's role in many other genocides; the Church created, participated in, promoted and condoned, the genocide and exile of Jews and Muslims during the Inquisition. The Catholic Church is responsible for mass murder, forced conversion, and genocide during the Crusades as well as during the colonial conquests in North America, South America, and Central America. Today, the Catholic Church presently promotes missionary work seeking the mass conversion of Indigenous peoples around the world. The Church seeks to destroy traditional Indigenous ways of life and Indigenous spiritual practices. The Catholic Church in Bolivia has actively collaborated in the coup d'état that has illegally deposed and exiled President Evo Morales, the legitimate and democratically elected head of state. Mexico's president has written to Pope Francis to ask for an apology for the Catholic church's role in the oppression of indigenous people in the Spanish conquest 500 years ago. The request was made in a two-page letter that also asked the Vatican to temporarily return several ancient indigenous manuscripts held in its library, ahead of next year's 500-year anniversary of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.If you're looking for a philosophy or spiritual practice which promotes peace and compassion, try a different denomination of Christianity like the Unitarian Church, or the United Church, or Unitarian Universalism. You can even venture outside of Christianity. Jesus was a Jew so why not explore Jewish thought and philosophy; Reform Judaism is an excellent denomination. Kabbalah mysticism is excellent spirituality as well. Sufism, a form of Islamic mysticism, is also an excellent philosophical tradition. You can go further East with Confucianism and Taoism. And last but not least are the oldest philosophies in the world, the Indian schools of though which promote compassion and nonviolence, such as Sanatana Dharma (a term that describes what we in the West call by the overly simplified exonym: Hinduism) and of course Buddhist philosophies.",1,3/23/2021,Rajendra Réjean K.

571,"Been here at least a half a dozen times over the last 20 years (visits even predate YELP) but this is the first time I have reviewed. This minor basilica of the Catholic Church (the largest church in Canada) is dedicated to the life and times of St. Joseph due to the devotion of a little Holy Cross Brother by the name of Andre Bessette - now St. Andre because of his 2010 canonization in Rome. St. Andre is the first and only member of the Congregation of Holy Cross to be canonized; the Congregation is also the founder of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. The basilica in Quebec Canada sits atop Mount Royal and dominates the sight-lines of all of Montreal. This basilica - The Oratory - began with a little chapel in 1904 on the mountainside which arose because of Brother Andre's work. His day job was as the porter and doorman across the street at the Notre Dame College of the Holy Cross order - a position he retained for over 40 years. The lower church (the crypt church) was finished in 1917, the cornerstone of the basilica was laid in 1924, construction of the upper church (the basilica) was stopped by the Great Depression and not restarted until 1937. The basilica officially opened in 1956, and the interior was finished in 1967 - just in time for the opening of Expo 67 (the centennial celebration of the Canadian Confederation).The basilica is a wonder to visit. Entrance is free. This venue is generally crowded as it is one of the most popular tourist sites in Canada ... but do visit. They are going through a rehab right now to reconstruct the parking lots and access point into the basilica - but even though it is crowded and messy, do visit if you have the chance.

572,"Went here during our trip to Montreal.  There are lots of steps to walk up to go inside and we saw a woman running up/down them as part of an exercise regime.  I think just walking up the steps is exercise for most people.  It is Canada's largest church and is reputed to have the largest dome in the world!  There is some construction going on and from the sounds of things, it will continue for some time.  The drawings show that you will be able to go up into the dome when it is finished.  There is already quite a view from the middle level of the church!  Although there is lots of beauty, it is not an interior style that appeals much to me nor the rest of my family.  You can see and hear a fantastic pipe organ and concerts are given on Sunday's for free along with a large screen projector, but I have no idea what that means.  While we were there, someone was playing the organ, but not doing the best job.  Surely if you are an organist, you would love to have the opportunity to play there.  I really enjoy a large hall with hundreds of candles that you could light for other people or intentions.  Surprisingly, when you look at the candles through your cellphone, you realize that words are spelled out in the red or white containers for the candles.  Messages of biblical meaning.  It was very nice to see that touch.  Also, in that hall, there were hundreds of crutches hanging up which represents all the people who had been healed there through the years.  There was a museum, gift shop and a cafe, too.",4,3/10/2020,Carolyn B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=D0Caw5JJXmQQ5luhH7ZvxQ,"Cincinnati, OH",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

I would definitely recommend coming here if you're visiting. Pick a day where the weather is nice, & that'll add to the experience. The building has 8 floors, elevators; & is handicap accessible. I believe there are tours given, as I saw staff walking around with visitors.

575,"This was on our city pass, and although it is a little far from main downtown montreal, it is easy to find by metro.After exiting the metro station, we walked a few short blocks through a small town with a cluster of stores and restaurants. This was the first street I encountered that had signs to point us to the direction of the landmarks we wanted to see. As we turned right after crossing the street, it was only a short distance where we could see the oratory. Entering the area towards the oratory was a landscape of beautiful flowers and grass.Then we had to walk up lots of concrete stairs, but it wasn't too bad because after a short walk of stairs, it flattened out to rest and take pictures of the city  and oratory. The middle stair had signs at French, and it was for those who walk up and pray on the stairs. There were many entrances to the oratory, and so much to see.  It took us at least 4 hours to go through the  whole 4 floors of the oratory and garden. The stations of the cross garden was a very peaceful walk up a semi steep road, with beautiful statues to reflect on, ending with water pouring out a golden lamb into a pond, and a view of the side of the oratory.Although the oratory closes at 8:30, we missed the museum because the museum closes at 4:30pm.Lots of parking, and if you do drive, you at least are able to bypass the stairs going towards the oratory.",5,6/19/2018,Val D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=itNrmwmb2Tm-LKkh2kbBAg,"Honolulu, HI",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

578,"Definitely worth seeing while in Montreal. You can see an awesome view of Montreal while on the top of the Mont Royal. I've been here before when I was a kid, but now back at it as an adult it was just lovely. Get your walking shoes on because in order to enter you have to climb the mountain and the stairway is lengthy. For me wearing a dress that day not the best idea I must say. Because what's cool was the fact that they had three separate rows of stairways. The one that stood out to me was the wooden one where you'd have to make the climb to the top on your knees which represents the sacrifice our fathers made before us and your taking that journey and if you make a wish and succeed the climb your wish comes true. (Next time must where jeans lol) Saint Joseph' Oratory is huge with 6 levels. 1- Welcome center-Votive chapel, Brother Andres Tomb, Statue of the Virgin, Saint Joseph Oil, Crypt Church, and Hall of Renovation Project, 3- Rest area, 4-Brother Andre's Heart and display on his life. 5- The Oratory Museum, 6- Basilica, Original Chapel, Saint Andre Bessette Chapel.Parking is free if you are a student of the University of Montreal or $5 if not and admission is free to the church. However the museum inside is I recall $5 per person.We saw the outdoor garden which depicted Christ's journey with numerous statues and nice horticulture. It was peaceful and serene. We also saw the museum which housed unique displays of nativity scenes throughout the world which was really cool to see. They also had art sculptures, old town maps of Montreal, and beautiful paintings.

Despite its humble beginnings in the early 1900s, the oratory has undergone many expansions. It is very well maintained and you'll be rewarded with a beautiful view of Montreal at the top of the steps.Speaking of steps, feeling like you've been a horrible human being lately? You can repent your sins by climbing up the stairs of penance on your knees.Due to time constraints, I didn't get a chance to visit the inside, but I'd love to come back to learn more about the history and architecture.Overall, an awe-inspiring view even for the non-religious.

The architecture is incredible and awe-inspiring, and it definitely gives you a sense of wonderment.

But as a destination and a thing to see in Montreal, this is truly a special one. There are some stairs, and an elevator that cuts out the elevation, and the lookout points have some incredible views. There is much to explore at the Oratory, so be sure and plan ahead so you see it all.It is Canada's largest church, and a national shrine. and a reliquary in the church museum contains Brother Andre's heart the Saint who founded the church as a small chapel back in 1904.",5,9/23/2016,Michael B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gk7QzENtPjq6gRznGkvcOA,"La Cañada Flintridge, CA",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

If you're walking, good luck. Contrary to prior reviews, parking was free for me (New Year's Special?). The parking lot attendant/traffic enforcer did not ask me for money and I saw no kiosk to pay for parking. Oh well! (Trust me, I more than made up for it at the gift shop).So much beauty and history!

You can park on the lower level and work your way up, or drive to the top and park there and work your way down. Keep in mind that the parking on top is limited. After not being able to find a space up top, we drove back down to the bottom where there was tons of parking. We worked our way up, which included a decent amount of stairs. Note that once inside, there are a few escalators and even an elevator which makes life easier. The oratory is great with lots to see. The experience itself is free. There is a gift shop on the top with lots of great items included rosaries. Throughout the oratory you can also purchase little guides for a $2 donation. There is a chapel and a shrine area. Behind the shrine is a tomb, which was interesting to see. Also the views fro the top are great, as are the views from the bottom. Be sure to stop along each level and take pics.

588,"One of the joys of living in CDN is the close proximity to one of Montreal's iconic sites, L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph, perched along the southwestern side of Mont-Royal. If you are a senseless running enthusiast like myself and wish to torture yourself trying to run up those steps, be forewarned. That said, the reward at the top is worth it. On occasion I've ventured into the actual church itself, which is lovely. I'm somewhat of a recovering catholic, but still know my Our Fathers and Hail Marys, and can probably recite the Apostle's Creed on cue. On a non-mass day, sitting in a pew in the spacious Basilica offers perhaps one of Montreal's most peaceful settings. Speaking of which, there is a prayer garden outside (only open during the warmer months) where one might venture into to seek inner peace. And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the candle hall, where visitors can light a candle and offer a prayer (for a small fee). But the best feature of Saint-Joseph's is of course the view. On warmer days, I've sat on the steps just outside the Basilica and seen the most beautiful Montreal sunsets. Even this winter day, I still got to enjoy the view from the snow-covered stairs.

Many pilgrims climb the stairs on their knees.This is the world's largest church dedicated to Saint Joseph, to whom Brother André credited all his reported miracles. There is a huge display wall covered with thousands of crutches from those who came to the Oratoire and were healed, at the point that Brother André in 1982 was canonized saint a few years ago.

There is a room with thousands of candles and a museum dedicated to Brother André, where it is possible to see his heart, which he requested as a protection for the basilica.

Architecturally, this is a beautiful place. The church itself is nothing special to look at compared to Notre-Dame or some of the churches I saw in Italy, but the energetic pull of the place is something else. You will see many a devout person attending mass here, lighting candles for a loved one or, more importantly, making their pilgrimage to the oratory, from the bottom of the parking lot, up the stairs, on their knees. No, I'm not kidding. St. Joseph's Oratory was home to the now famous Frère André, who was known to heal the crippled, the paralyzed - you name it.

I'm not a religious person so this place didn't have the same effect on my as it would for say, a practicing Catholic. The architecture is nice and seemed very modern on the inside considering it was built in the late 20's. It's a very large building with lots of different chapels. There's always a mass going in one of them somewhere. The main cathedral is over-the-top big and I'm assuming is supposed to make you feel small compared to the hugeness of the catholic mafia... err I mean, god.Since we went in winter, the gardens and other outdoor areas were closed for the season so I didn't get to see all of it.

617,"St. Joseph's Oratory is a breathtaking sanctuary built by the newly canonized Saint in the Catholic Church, Brother Andre, in dedication to St. Joseph. I've visited the Oratory many times, and each time the grand splendour of the building grasped me. Many stairs are to be climbed in order to enter, or you can drive up- the Oratory is placed in a high hill. Inside, the atmosphere is quiet & spiritual. Pilgrims are in prayers and Catholic Mass is held within the crypt of the church many times a day. There is an info desk where you can pick up an ""arrow guide book""- $2, in order to give yourself a tour without getting lost.What you'll find in the Oratory:The Lamp Hallway- This is a warm, dim-lighted hallway with over thousands of vigil lights that you can light for $1. This hallway has many people in prayer.Brother Andre's Tomb- Connected to the lamp hallway, rests the remains of Brother Andre who died on Jan 6, 1937. Here also, people are silent in prayer and veneration towards the newly canonized saint.The Crypt Church- Simple yet beautiful, this is the main place where the services are held throughout the day. I couldn't help but notice the beautiful statue of the main alter of St. Joseph and the marble and oak used in the crypt, very beautiful.Terrance on the Roof- The Oratory has a huge terrance that allows people to have a panoramic view of all the North-Western area of Montreal. You can see the Laurentian Mountains, lake St. Louis and St. Lawrence River. This is a must see and is breathtaking!Brother Andre Wax Display- There is an exhibit showcasing Brother Andre's doorkeeper's lodge, office, hospital, and his preserved heart!The Way of the Cross Garden- A beautiful garden on a hill shows off the natural environment and beauty. As you climb the hill, you see marble religious statues depicting each station of the cross. This garden is outside but attached to the Oratory.The Museum- For around $4 (adult fare) you can see the museum that has an impressive collection of religious art from the Renaissance period, and so much more.There is so much more: Brother Andre's room, original chapel, the souvenir shop (great variety of religious articles, medals and more for very reasonable prices), the cafeteria (offers full course meals), and the Carillion- largest church bells in North America. I had the opportunity to hear them before Mass, the quality and sound of the bells is outstanding!The entire Oratory staff is kind and helpful. The grounds and Oratory itself are maintained very well. I can't wait to come back here again!St. Joseph's Oratory is visited by pilgrims around the world in the thousands each year.

618,"We took advantage of UA's weekend special to visit Montreal over the weekend.  The weather got bad after we book the trip and hotel.  It was raining most the days we are in Montreal.  After taking the bus tour to Quebec in the rain on Sunday, we planned out two different trips for Monday.  One for rain one for no-rain.No rain when we got up so we walked from our hotel and took bus 165 from Guy street to go to the St. Joseph's Oratory.   I used Google map to plan out the bus/walk trip.  It was a lot nicer to walk on Rue Sherbrooke because you pass by a lot of museum and hotels than Boul De Maisonneuve.  The bus ride was not bad.  We met other people who also on their way to the Oratory.  The bus driver told us when to get off and how to walk to the Oratory.  You can also see the tall Oratory when you get off the bus.  Bus 165 did not drop you off in front of the Oratory.  Bus 166 and 51 are the one in the front of the Oratory.When we took the 3.5 hours Montreal bus tour on Saturday afternoon, the tour guide told us there were a lot of steps to go up to the Oratory and it is not recommended.  We had choice between Oratory ($5) and the Botanical Garden ($17.75).  Since it may rain so I picked Oratory.   I learned from past touring experiences it is better to take the ""road"" for car not the stairs for people from our Quebec trip.  I saw the ""shuttle"" sign as soon as you got into the gate at the Oratory next to the info center so we took the shuttle up to the Oratory so I did not have to walk any steps!The Oratory only had 3-guided tour ($5) per day, one at 10 and one at 13:30.  We got there at 10:40 so we paid $2 for a self-guided book.  You can also get a free map if you don't want to buy the book.  I paid $0.50 for a bottle for the holy water near the entrance where the shuttle dropped you off. The inside is a little dark so you cannot really read the book.  We ended up just walk around where we wanted to go without using the map or the guide book.   We found #9 The Way of the Cross and the Gardens of the Oratory right the way.  This was a total surprised since we only expected to see a church not a garden for our trip.  The pool/fountain was closed for cleaning.  A lot of up hill walking, no steps!  I was so happy we took the shuttle so I saved my legs for the garden.My daughter loved #7 The terrace on the roof.  She was able to take a lot of different photos of Montreal with her fancy camera.  This is a good place to read the guide book so you will not miss any exhibits and learned about the history.  I made the mistake until we got home and read the book.Warning - #8 Display-Brother Andre because they have ""The heart of Brother Andre"" on display there!  We were glade we missed this.We took the ""road"" and ""steps"" on our way down so it was not so bad on my legs.  We took bus 51 across the street from the Oratory and got off at the Metro stop to take the orange line (Montmorency direction) to Old Montreal - Place-D'Armes.This experience is very different from Notre Dame.  This was my favorite place to visit in Montreal so don't be scared off by the tour guide about the 100 steps to the Oratory!",4,6/17/2013,Jul W.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WY-kbfhVHp_ZOGxxsc5Ctw,"Scottsdale, AZ",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
619,"Driving in from the south, the imposing dome of St. Joseph's is visible from 20 km out - the first visual confirmation that you're getting close to Montreal. For a tourist, this hulking presence is almost impossible to resist, and all the guidebooks confirm that the church is a Top 10 attraction, so of course you make time for a visit. As you pull into the parking lot, picking your way through tour buses packed with pilgrims, you're struck again by the sheer mass of the building perched atop one of the highest points in the city. As you climb the interminable stairs up the side of the mountain, you start to anticipate the architectural beauties that await you at the summit. Several hundred calories later, you finally enter the sanctuary, ready for a payoff that never really comes. Turns out the ooh's and ah's of St. Joseph's are mostly generated down below. At the top, the views are endless, but not especially awe-inspiring, because you're looking away from the Montreal skyline. And the inside of the church is nearly Spartan in its simplicity, with very little to distract your eye from the huge dome overhead. What little effort is made at decoration tends toward a monochromatic, slightly depressing style with a nod to Chagall.",2,9/2/2014,Robert J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qVAXmPLZMyTxONGIrS3gyg,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

The church museum has a display of nativity scenes from all over the world....France is ultra modern, Martinique was all coconuts and China looked like it belonged in a fish tank.

625,"A completely different experience from Notre-Dame in the old section of the city near the port, but also a must-see destination in Montreal.This church was inspired by now sainted Andre Bessette who was a poor and not well-educated humble French-Canadian priest who devoted his life to helping the poor and the ill.  Many came to see him to be cured of their ailments.  Bessette started his work from a small wooden chapel, which is still there, and donations came in which allowed the Oratory to be built.The Oratory is in Cote-des-Neiges, slightly northwest of Centre-Ville, and it essentially shares the mountain in the middle of the city with Parc Mont-Royal.  It is an imposing structure, atop a big flight of stairs.  However, the parking (no longer free, so no Oratory visit last time) also climbs up to the sides of the complex and there are ways to get into the complex at grade, without stairs.  Its cupola is reportedly the 3rd largest umbrella dome in the world, and maybe the largest cupola in Canada.  The place holds some kind of record in Canada. The interior of the main church is solemn and the simple geometric beveling inside indicates an art deco style (not as in Miami Beach, but just art deco).  The main church is extremely tall, somewhat plain, and very quiet.  For a more intimate experience, the crypt church below is where most Masses are celebrated and it's a lot less ominous because of the much lower ceiling.  Masses are held in, at the very least, French and English.  There are some interesting things here, such as the huge staircase of candles in one of the wings, the museum, and the models of the church.As for the non-religious aspects, there are incredible views from the various terraces of the church.  Mind you, the mountain blocks the view toward the city, but one can look at the northern half of Montreal and all its northern suburbs beyond.  From up there, everything seems very quiet and still.  Generally, I don't like church gift shops, but this one is airy and has a lot of good tourist and/or religious articles you might buy.  There is also a cafeteria on site and, thankfully, it is very low-key and informal.  In general, the feeling here is very peaceful, so it's a shame they started charging for parking because a visit to the Oratory while in Montreal was always calming.",4,5/4/2013,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

641,"Really enjoyed this venue.  It is a large and spectacular basilica.  Enjoyed it more than Notre Dame in the old Montreal.  They have a great garden to walk through and they only request $5 for parking as opposed to charging entry per person like Notre Dame.  The view here is also spectacular and honestly, we are so over the gaudy gold alters of other churches.  This is more humble and has its own qualities.  There is also a separate chapel that Frere Andre built next to the large basilica to see and when we went, it wasn't crowded at all.  Very much worth the trip.",5,8/21/2016,F O.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=OCBlmyO1xLb2hSE7KQqm6w,"Irvine, CA",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

643,"Surely one of the largest and most spectacular religious structures in North America. Situated atop Mont Royal, it boasts a gorgeous view. Fascinating stories about Brother Andre (now canonized) -- I wonder what he'd think of his tiny chapel now.   It's a stunningly contemporary design inside, and the organ is amazing. The votive chapel is lovely, and directly behind it is Brother Andre's tomb (his heart's located elsewhere in the building) and a glimpse at the part of Mont Royal the oratiry was built into. The lame crawl up the stairs to the oratory, and the crutches and canes displayed in the votive chapel attest to the faith of those visitors.",5,6/17/2014,Richard H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-KduD3wwydWDq2GrODh2tw,"Indianapolis, IN",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
644,"The Oratoire Saint Joseph is quite a landmark, as it can be seen from incredibly far away across Montreal. But Getting up there can be a hassle if you're a pedestrian, and once you do make it up, the chapel inside is very lean. There is nothing to see. No art, no decorations, nothing at all except high white walls and dark wooden seats. I'm sure they're impressive in their own way, but being European I must admit that after having done the climb once, I was massively disappointed! They do have a very popular Christmas service, but I haven't been to it as I am not Catholic. On the other hand, the view from above the observatory is delightful, and a place I would definitely go visit again. To get there you need a car and a very good knowledge of the back streets of the Mount Royal, but it's definitely worth it.",2,11/18/2008,Sophie E.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nD-jmtxTaLuimmYpwlQ3ZQ,"London, United Kingdom",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

647,"Let me start off by saying I'm a former militant Catholic (Bible-carrying, judging other people, celibate, thinking I'm better than others, the whole nine yards) and a current bitter, cynical atheist (being an asshole, judging other people, thinking I'm better than others, being celibate but not on purpose, the whole nine yards).  Reading the other reviews, I can see that most people have a religious or non-religious bias, which is understandable.  I'm here to tell you that I've been to both sides, and as biased as it's going to be anyway, I will tell you about this place straight up for what it is.First off, this is one of the most underrated tourist attractions in Montreal.  I don't know why the hell people don't flock to this place like crazy.  When you first see it, the utter immensity of it hits you straight in the skull.  The sheer manpower it took to construct this beautiful piece of art is just jaw-dropping.  The first time I went I actually had to pick up my jaw off the floor.  OFF THE FLOOR.  It took 12 hours to surgically re-attach it at the Jewish General Hospital afterwards.  THAT'S HOW HUGE AND POWERFUL IT IS.All joking aside, this place will have an impact on you.  I've been to it over 50 times.  This is not an exaggeration.  Go on a Sunday morning, when pilgrims from many different countries (as well as from here) go up the steps on their knees, praying at each step.  Whether or not you are Catholic or believe in God, you can witness the power of religion and its positive effect on people here.  You will see a beautiful view of the northern part of the city from the top.  Inside you will see beautiful architecture and can get a tour of the grounds and insides.  There's a small little ""tunnel"" in the back where the ventilation vents out, and it smells like Bibles.  Go ahead and check it out.  You'll know exactly what I mean.It's interesting to see the old church Saint Andre built before the Oratory was constructed as well.  Although St-Joseph's Oratory is closed at night, you can walk around and/or go up the stairs for a mind-blowing view at anytime.  I would, in fact, recommend doing that at least once.  It is one peaceful place.",5,10/30/2011,Marc A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3mVMqNIvOumVbkyHXNmgUg,"Montreal, Canada",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal
648,"Please let me preface with saying that St. Joseph is one of my favorite saints, the other being St. Michael the Archangel. That being said, the Oratory was my Disneyland! My boyfriend-now-husband Floyd surprised me by planning a visit up here from Boston, where we both lived at the time. We're both very active Catholics and spent hours exploring the Oratory. I've visited many basilicas in Italy and of course the Oratory doesn't compare, but it is still a very special place for me.One of the first things we noticed was the four flights of stairs and three pedestrian crosswalks in between each set leading to the Oratory, which I believe is the highest point in Montreal and the second largest dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The middle set of wooden stairs was reserved for pilgrims climbing up on their knees. We both looked forward to attempting the stair climb at the end of our visit.After the Way of the Cross in the garden (Floyd made me pose and take photos next to each station, saying ""It's like each station is a prize on Wheel of Fortune...""), the multiple chapels, and other sites within and around the Oratory, hours passed and Floyd wanted to climb the stairs before sunset. He insisted I stay at the top to take pictures of him, with the excuse that I was in a dress and would hurt my knees. I agreed and Floyd made his way down. As he climbed up, I noticed Floyd clasping his hands, and I assumed it was in act of reverence and prayer. Tourists started staring as he neared the top, and with Floyd beginning to struggle in the heat, I encouraged him to climb the last set of stairs. Upon the last step, after my congratulatory remarks, Floyd urged me to come close. We embraced and Floyd whispered plenty of sweet nothings, including that he would try his best to ""be your St. Joseph, and there'd be nothing more lovely than to have you as my Mother Mary."" He exposed the ring he held in his hands the way up the stairs, asked me for my hand in marriage, and naturally, I beamed and exclaimed, ""Yes!"" We rushed back in, just in time to have one of the priests bless my engagement ring before he left for the day and light a few candles, especially the one for St. Joseph, Head of the Holy Family. It was the most beautiful, fitting proposal, and I will always fondly remember the Oratory as the place we got engaged. I definitely would love to visit again for one of our future anniversaries. Even if I hadn't gotten engaged here, this place is a must-visit for both Catholics and non-Catholics who can appreciate such beauty.",5,5/14/2011,Rochelle A.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Y7At-JJE35ZrKaGH3Pt1Pw,"Greenville, SC",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

650,"I really have a hard time believing I am the first to review this. This was an exceptional place to visit. Built in the 1960s, it's a shrine dedicated to Jesus' father, Saint Joseph, by the Brothers of the Congregation of the Holy Cross.  It seems one of the monks, Brother Andre (who dreamed of this place) also was known for his curative miracles and people from all over Canada and the world make the pilgrimage here yearly.  It's got four chapels and the basilica (chapels is a loose term-the largest holds upwards of 1000 people) all of which are available for self-guided tour.  There is also the tomb of Brother Andre, a permanent exhibit dedicated to his life, a museum on the history of the holy family, and (seasonally) the shrine gardens for viewing.  The museum is known for its' permanent exhibit of nativity creches from around the world. Guided tours are given and probably the best way to see most of the Oratory quickly, but you can do just a well picking up a brochure at the visitor's center and taking the complex at your own pace. Personally, I think most impressive features are the Crypt Church with its' stained glass windows, the 300 steps (or 99 kneeling steps for pilgrims) to the basilica, and the Votive Chapel where previous grantees of Brother Andre's miracles left their crutches and canes.  Although not impressive at all (as it should be), the chapel of Brother Andre is the original site of his miracles and is located away from the grandeur of the basilica. A word of caution, the Oratory, being built in the mid-1900s, is modern and doesn't have quite the ornamentation of older pre-1900 churches, but nonetheless, it is just as impressive.  It also features a carillon (bell tower) that gives performances most days of the week and a world renown Boys' Choir (Petits Chanteurs du Mont-Royal) which tours internationally in the summer.  I think they are almost as good as Vienna's Boys' Choir.The shrine does have a touristy side with a gift shop and cafe, but at least the Oratory hasn't started charging admission, although they do ask for a donation to view the museum.  There also is a small hostel for pilgrims to the shrine who will be staying overnight.  I did the entire thing in several hours, but you can probably get through it in a hour or less if you want to.  Being a shrine of medical miracles, the place is definitely wheelchair accessible, but to walk the Oratory is a bit of hike.  The basilica sits on the western part of Parc du Mont-Royal and the dome can be seen all over Montreal (I think it's actually the highest point in Montreal.)  The closest Metro stop is Cote des Neiges, but it still a long walk from the Metro station.  I suspect you can catch a bus from the Metro station though.  Also check the website for additional information such as open times.It's a must see in my opinion that definitely doesn't break the bank (READ: Free!)",5,6/11/2009,Lindsey J.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ksQQ8Ff0BgmQ3X7NG3GVhg,"Billings, MT",L’Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal

When we told her we were just a group of tourists she threatened to call security and rudely insisted that we leave immediately. This was a terrible experience for us.

652,"I would put 4-5 stars if I was religious. From a esthetic point of view, all tourist will visit at the very least one Catholic Church.

There's about 200-300 stairs easy. for Elder/ Disable / Inactive people not so interested by it, there's an Elevetor from the very bottom. There's also in Christmas time some nice Crèche (In English? Nativity Scene... I dunno)  expositions. There's som guided Tour or simply follow your instinct and walk all over the place. There's some Choir for pretty much every Mess and  it's one of the best panorama you'll have from Montreal. It's not really the same view as  Plateau Mont-Royal. I'd also suggest tourist to discover Cote-Des-Neiges area. Over 100 different cultural community, lot of nice little market/store.

Also for things like mandarin/banana trees, it was so tempting to take some of that fresh picked fruit, but obviously I had to be a good samaritan and not touch it as the signs indicated.

656,"What a breathtakingly beautiful place with all types of colorful blooming flowers, green grassy areas, blue bodies of water and more! My favorite gardens were Chinese Garden, Rose Garden, and Flowery Brook. Upon entering, you are privy to Reception Gardens which are tall trees, flowers and a walkway leading to a fountain and the stately, impressive library on the grounds. My friends and I then started off going through the greenhouse exhibition grounds, which was my least favorite portion because I'm not really a fan of greenhouses. Most of it was warm, tropical with cactuses and green plants. I did like the orchids, bridge, and pond though. We continued on to the Rose Garden and Aquatic Garden. Roses are my favorite flowers, so I enjoyed this garden immensely. There were pinkish-yellow, red, orange, pale pink, purple, yellow-colored roses, as well as a pretty arch and statue of a joyful young girl. The Aquatic Garden were different pools of water with little fountains. It was very calming and refreshing to walk through it. Next was the Chinese Garden which was incredibly impressive! The entrance was through a foresty bunch of trees with red and gold lanterns hanging up above. There was also a red and black pagoda and inside the pavilion, crystal blue clear water with lantern art of fishermen and boats, orange and blue fishes, a huge bird, etc. All of this is surrounded by lush green grass, lilacs, pandas and bamboo lantern art display, rocks, Chinese style buildings, and a natural-looking waterfall on a rocky cliff. After that, we checked out the Japanese Garden which was not all that compared to what I just experienced in the Chinese Garden. There was a bonsai display, lantern art of cranes in the grass and a small cultural center. Then there was the Shrub Garden and Alpine Garden. The Shrub one was a little boring for me, but the Alpine Garden had this wild, unbridled beauty with all the rocks, bodies of water and different types of trees. We also saw the Lilacs and Flowery Brook, which boasted all kinds of flowers of red, pink, purple, white, orange, along with leaves of purple, yellow, green and more. It was truly a sight to behold and there was a large body of water with lily pads and marsh-like atmosphere.There were arboretum trails that we did not get a chance to check out, but I was very happy with what we experienced.",4,10/6/2019,Kathy X.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RJH925_Ci598EuRx9JoGwA,"Brooklyn, NY",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
657,"As of August 2019, the Biodome and Insectarium are closed for renovation. I believe the insectarium is supposed to re-open in August 2020. That being said, they don't really have any other exhibits if that's what you're interested in. They have different garden areas for different groups of flowers/plants (i.e. roses, lilacs). My favorite was probably the poisonous plants because it was interesting to read about them. Although they're not really blocked off so if you're bringing children there, you should probably keep an eye on them. I saw one little girl wandering into the bushes as the mom just looked on. Questionable, but not my place to say anything. Anyway, there's also a Japanese and a Chinese garden which were a bit lame.Overall, I'm not sure it was worth the price for what we saw. The price for an adult is $20.50. If you have a student ID, it's $15. I believe they have a parking lot for $12, but we were able to find street parking nearby. Just be mindful of the street cleaning/rush hour signs and you should be fine.Tip - allot yourself at least 2.5 to 3 hours to see everything.

They have a nice handful of little gardens which are very pleasant to the eye. Our absolute favorite was the Chinese garden that is pictured in my review. It really was a beauty seeing all the dragons and pagodas and boats in this section. We spent a good amount of time here taking pictures of everything we could. If you start off from the side by the Olympic Stadium and Science Center, the garden will become less and less vibrant as you go on until you finally exit on Sherbrooke.

The Bloedel Conservatory in Vancouver still takes the top spot for me.I was fully aware that the Chinese gardens were closed for renovations (they warn you of this before you buy your ticket), but what they should really warn you is that the Garden Sculptures are no longer there, unlike what the pictures proliferating on Pinterest tell you.The remaining gardens were on the lackluster side for me, and the map was a bit confusing but I guess breathing in some fresh air is a positive either way. The Insectarium was a fun side trip inside the gardens. Seeing the leaf-cutter ants haul food back into their nest was a neat treat. My favorite was the Greenhouse, which was actually a long chain of connected greenhouses, taking you through the various climates and displaying the plants that thrive in them.Overall, not the best botanic garden out there, but worth a stop if you have kids or loads of time to kill.  3.75",3,10/15/2017,Sylvia Y.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZdizwYwPiIlhK3G2u-fZnA,"Santa Clara, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

Chinese garden is currently under construction. Every park was breathtaking! Zen by the pond and waterfalls. There were benches tucked away in every spot for your reading or relaxing pleasure. There were more shaded trails for those wanting to hide from the sun!

It's a cool place to take photos, so my friends Rafael and Mehek came prepared with their fancy cameras.For a place with free admission, it was surprisingly thorough and well worth the visit. The greenhouse featured several exquisite plant specimens from all over the world. Outside appeared to be several stands offering their plant goods. Maybe that's why admission was free on that day, in order to support these various businesses. That's just my guess, so don't quote me on that.There was also an insectarium clearly meant for children, with free admission as well.

The indoor garden was very clean and there was barely any bugs or flies. There is also a lot of nice bonsai trees.The outside was very nice too, there was random flowers here and there.

I had a minor confrontation with a gentleman because I saw him scooping up butterflies on several occasions. Aren't people aware that touching them damages their wings which eventually kill them sooner? Given the number of butterflies with ragged wings, I guess not.The green houses are beautiful. I worked really hard not to take a photo every single plant.The Insectarium was something new for me as I've never been to one before. I rather enjoyed looking at all the creepy crawlies.

Nope we arrived at building made of wood with a balcony and just explained about treehouses. Took all of 3mins to explore, the trolley waits 10mins and then takes people back to the exit.

697,"Montreal has several areas with notable attractions with only one of major import being east of Centre-Ville.  That would be the Olympic Village.  The first things that people notice and may want to see are the Inclined Tower and the stadium, nicknamed the ""Big Ow"" for its final price tag.  I've reviewed the Inclined Tower.  Also on the same side of the street and adjacent to the stadium and the tower are the Biodome, a natatorium, and a few other points of interest.  The Biodome is worth visiting at least once.  I've also reviewed it.Because it was across the street and because one is conditioned to usually having a city's botanical garden be free of charge, it took a while longer to finally get over and see it across various trips to this unique city.  It costs somewhere in the $20 CDN range and I believe there was a discount for holders of the AAA/CAA card, as was the case at the Inclined Tower.  Once you get into the Botanical Garden, you really understand how large it is and the care and maintenance that it requires.  And you're glad you went in and paid that tab.  The grounds are laid out according to themes, sometimes with areas of where the plants come from geographically, sometimes as formal gardens, and sometimes according to the season in which they bloom.  About the bloom schedule, this sort of information is available, is sort of consistent across the years, and, if this is a key factor of how to time your visit to Montreal and the Botanical Garden, then you will need to work around that to see the types of plants and flowers you'd like to see.  For most people, I would assume that a visit to Montreal is based on other things, such as autumn color change, summer weather, a music festival, or a sporting event.  Two gardens or exhibits are especially interesting, yet very different from each other.   There is a Japanese pavilion with the more restrained horticulture and art you'd expect to see.  On the other hand, the Chinese exhibit and garden is larger and a lot more elaborate, with a pond, foot bridges, and structures which, to most people, would appear to be authentically Chinese in their inspiration.  There is also an insectarium with (interactive) displays at the Botanical Garden, and it is included with admission.  And, in the middle of it all is a lake with lawns around it.The Botanical Garden can be reached by car, and there is an ample sized parking lot, and it can also be reached by transit, either by the Metro or by bus, both of which stop practically next to it.  It can be visited in conjunction with a visit to the other attractions across the street or by itself.  Of all the attractions in and around the Olympic complex, my nod goes to the Inclined Tower, followed by this - the Botanical Garden - followed by the Biodome.  The Botanical Garden is beautiful but, because of it being different during various parts of the year, will present you with an experience that will please you more ... or less, relative to another visit.  Regardless, I'd be willing to go back and shell out almost $20 CDN at the ""right"" time of year.  I enjoyed it.",4,5/22/2017,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

If you're gardener or have even a slight interest in plant life you must go.

A day could easily be spent here and you could write a review about it spanning pages. Inside and out there are many exhibits to see and learn about.

We got there at about 2:30 PM on a Sunday. Parking is a flat fee of $12. You pay at a multimeter and then place the paid ticket in the dash of your vehicle. There was a fairly short line to get tickets and 3 tellers, but it took forever!!! 2 out of the 3 people that were being tended to were getting tickets for large groups and practically arguing with the garden staff as to their discounts... We finally got our tickets after about 20-25 minutes in line. The ticket person was very nice and accepted my AAA discount. The 1 site rate is $20 CDA for adults and $10 CDA for children. The AAA discount takes off about $1-2. After getting our tickets we started walking through the gardens. The gardens are very big. One thing that seemed to pop up when googling the garden is a few large sculptures, the most notable being a large one with a large head, hand and waterfall. We were later told by staff that that had been taken down a while ago. So mush of the garden seemed to but under construction or incomplete. One thing that saved the trip was the insectarium which is located within the garden grounds and included in the price of the garden admission. It was very informative and interesting.

I've been to several botanical gardens and this is one of the best. In particular,  the perennial garden and alpine garden (forest?) were outstanding. In a couple of weeks,  even more plants will be in bloom,  but many were already in color and impressive. Beyond the perennial beds,  when you get near the ponds (water lilies,  etc) there is an area lush with peonies, irises and other beauties and is not to be missed. In two weeks or so,  the roses will all be blooming and should be spectacular.  The onsite restaurant food was surprisingly good and not terribly overpriced. The greenhouses had a wide variety of flowers,  ferns, desert plants and an impressive bonsai exhibit. Great photo opportunities at every turn.  Glad we read several reviews and ignored those who talked about empty beds, etc... Just saw so many wonderful sights here,  we were impressed!

The ground are just okay overall.We were particularly upset that it cost money to park ($12) AND you HAVE to pay ($20) per adult with zero discount offers. We tried to explain to the insectarium ticket people we only wished to walk the garden, but they said you must buy a ticket for the insect museum that is included with park entry. We felt like we wasted our money overall. We spent maybe 10 minutes in the insectarium and 20 minutes in the gardens because it was boring, underwhelming, and just not set up very well to guide you point to point.

709,"Honestly, this place is a tourist trap! We only got in the garden for 20 min and it starts raining. We saw the japanese garden which was not all that great. This place is for people that really love trees. Once you pay $20.50 to get in, you can go in and out for the day but not the next day. It would have been nice if we got a refund or an option to come back the next day. Im disapponted and will never go back.

710,"Before our trip to Montreal, we learned about the Chinese Lantern exhibit in the botanical garden and listed it as a ""Must See"".  Gorgeous handmade lanterns travel from China to Montreal for display in their ""Garden of Lights"". Admission was $15/person but worth every dime and the Metro will dump you within walking distance.We had a difficult time finding the ""Garden of Lights"" within the Botanical Garden because of the French language barrier and probably because some of the Canadians behave like rude French folks.  (Yes I said, ""French"" and ""folks"" in the same phrase).  But once we got our bearings (and Hubby peed behind a tree--it was THAT dark) we were off on an amazing path to loveliness. At one point, we were all lost from each other due to the crowd of people and children in strollers (they should really have an adult only night.)

Had we known there was a dedicated parking lot we would have opted for it but we actually parked in a nearby neighborhood and walked in the pedestrian entrance.But once in, we had a good time. The botanical gardens was very nice, with many sections to see, among tropical fruit trees, ferns, succulents, all in lush settings. The insectarium was small, a bit odd of a building, but our daughter enjoyed it a lot. Behind the insectarium is a good playground. From there, we went to the japanese garden, which was really nice, but the the chinese gardens were shut down for renovations.We didn't use the tram nor did anyone tell us about it when we bought our ticket so we walked everywhere.

With a short walking distance. Due to a short spring/summer period that Montreal has, the gardens are not open for long. Yet throughout the year, they will have many beautiful things to see indoors. One setback from all this? The rates! They differer from children to senior, or from Quebec resident to non-residents. Having said this. A family of four with their regular rates, will be spending around $100. Do I think it's worth the high cost? Absolutely! Yet, if you are a family.

It is such a beautiful well maintained Garden with ever changing garden and flower themes, there is always something new mixed in with the standard and familiar.

716,"This was on my to do list in Montreal but we were still iffy about it until I saw the lights decoration advertisement nearby our hotel. It's probably more worth it to see the garden with some kinda theme going on rather than seeing the garden itself only. PRICE$19.25 reg$14.25 with student ID$12 Parking- Wear comfortable shoes. There's A LOT of walking going on- Bring water and snacks. They don't check your bag- Get a map before you enterThis is probably one of the biggest botanical garden I've been to. It is huge so I guess for the price you paid, it's worth it to check out. It's probably as big as Huntington Park or even bigger in California but with more stuff to check out. I like how each section has a theme to it so whatever you don't like, you can easily skip through it. It's been awhile but what stood out the most to me was Chinese & Japanese Garden. Maybe we went during the time they had lights decoration so it wasn't as plain. Japanese Garden has this beautiful cranes lit up at night and it was gorgeous.

718,"Forget everything that you've known about visiting a botanical garden. The visit alone will change your experience and knowledge of plants and flowers. The ticket price is worth every cent from the beautiful sculptors and displays in addition to the lovely exhibits and attractions that the garden covers. Unfortunately, Hub and I were not able to visit and cover every section of the garden since we did all the attractions on the same day. We skipped the Tree House and Leslie-Hancock Garden and the Youth Gardens that was located all the way at the end of the museum. The botanical garden would take at least 3 hours to cover the entire premise for your visit. For those who need more time to venture and explore, no worries the admission is good for 2 days. Our fav area is definitely the popular Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The layout of the landscape design is literally covered in blooms, pavilion, and waterfalls. In terms of variation, the Chinese garden is known for the architecture and history of the Dynasty while the Japanese garden is known for combining all elements of the garden to create art and zen state of mind. As for the horticulturist-artists work, all of the mosaics were breathtaking. However, the work of the Mother Earth is a stunning and unforgettable creation. I can't even begin to describe the striking visual of the intricate shape of the hands opening up a waterfall and the other hand to a deer. Just by a glance tells you, not only does the sculpture look tedious but it definitely took hours of labor and toll to complete the piece of art.  And, you get to vote on your favorite work/sculpture at the International Hub to win a trip for 2 to Doha, Qatar until the end of this year.  For those who are into the whole garden scenery, the Insectarium might be more of your cup of tea. There are numerous collections and exhibits on the diverse insects. There's even a live demonstration for those brave enough to hold a scorpion. The leafcutter ants are pretty amazing. Each ant picks and cuts leafs to feed and harvest fungus where they feed and maintain their nest and defend their colony. Have fun on your visit.

Particularly during a very special week (that changes from year to year depending on climate) during Spring to watch the cherry blossoms trees bloom.The insectarium is very interesting as well though it took a huge step back for me when they no longer had the bee hives exposition. However, the ant exposition is very cool.The price tag can be somewhat expensive, I suggest checking online for coupons/deals to shave off a few dollars.

724,"To preface my review, I think your perception of this botanical garden really depends on which season you visit. When I went, in mid-April, it was still quite cold and the garden wasn't even charging admission in the outer exhibits. The feature was pretty much just the insectarium and the butterflies. I mean...the former was kinda good (but very small) and the latter could've been experienced for free at Changi airport in Singapore. Sure, there were a lot of butterflies, but it was kind of overkill. The line to see them was way too long and it was a bit underwhelming. I think it would've been cool to see the Chinese and Japanese gardens but they were unfortunately closed.

No. Just some flower groupings with some flower species not doing all that great in early September. The shade garden was in better shape than the flowers that lead into the Chinese garden.

I really wanted to grab a drink at the restaurant but there was an opera going on and there was a long line at 5 PM and they close at 6 PM.  I would recommend bringing water because the walk from the train station or the biodome is uphill and a bit of a walk for a hot summer day.  It was nice to stroll around the park.  There were a few wedding photographer and parties there.  The exits and entries are very confusing.,4,9/14/2015,Kim S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LfKztiKBS2P2_QoNeilWeQ,"Lowell, MA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

730,"If you are a tourist from out of town, the admission comes out to be about $19.00 per person with tax. A ticket gives you access to the Insectarium de Montreal and the train and shuttles that go throughout the garden. Here are some quick tips when coming here for a day trip:- Parking: If you want to park on the premises, it is $12 for the entire day. We are out of towners and didn't want to deal with trying to find street parking. You can park here and walk to the BioDome to save some money.- Gardens: There are a wide variety of gardens to go to. The China Garden, Japanese Garden, and Rose Garden. They even had a Natives Garden which was pretty unique. My only gripe is that the flowers were not exactly in bloom in the month of August. Most of the living things that we saw were plants. Even the rose garden was pretty sparse. Upkeep of the Chinese and Japanese structures were also pretty limited. The Chinese structures had cobwebs and didn't look well maintained.- Asian Friendly: I mean this in the nicest way possible, but I feel that my parents got a really good kick out of the gardens - mainly because they were able to reminisce on good times in Asia when walking through the Chinese gardens. They even have tea where you can sit on the porch of the gardens, drink tea, and chat as you look out into the koi pond area. The signs say not to feed the Koi fishes but the Koi fishes follow you around, which shows me that people do it anyway.- Mini Train: For those who can't walk very far, there is a mini train that takes you on a 15 minute tour of the entire garden area. There is also a free shuttle that takes you to different stops throughout the gardens.Bottom Line: A little expensive and not as well maintained as I thought it would be. It is definitely lower on the list of things to see in Montreal.",3,8/4/2014,Ivy T.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=G89MgEpjVkawmL1cMdM66w,"Garden Grove, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

In spring, we can see a lot of cherry blossom, lilac, peony, and so on in the garden; in summer, roses, lotus, hydrangeas, lilies are in full bloom; in fall, the magical lantern festival in the Chinese garden also amaze visitors, and even in winter, the Christmas garden sparkles and dazzles.

If you're a Montrealer, they have an Early Bird Card that costs $8 (!) that grants you access for ONE YEAR to the grounds between 6 and 9 AM. Great for runners and/or people who live in the area.The gardens are organized by type (e.g., rose, shrub, etc.), function (e.g., medicinal, edible, toxic), and theme (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Native). The gardens and paths are well maintained and there are lots of labels to tell you what's what. About half of the grounds (towards Rosemont) comprise the arboretum. A few notes about specific gardens... The Chinese gardens were undergoing renovations when we went, so the buildings were closed, but the gardens were otherwise open. There was a lot of construction fencing as well, which detracted from the garden's serenity, but it was still quite nice. There was a special exhibition at the Japanese gardens that featured some stunning works of art from survivors of Hiroshima.

On the day that we went, we saw two separate wedding photo shoots on location, along with a mix of several park visitors that were soaking up the views.The Japanese garden and the greenhouse are two other locations that I would recommend visiting.

Turns out no one was checking for tickets when we arrived at the garden. Mostly because nothing had bloomed yet. It will be so beautiful in the warm summer months (late May to early Sept). The garden is absolutely serene and stunning even though nothing was out yet. My favourite was likely the Chinese garden. They finally scanned our tickets when we got inside the building to look at the green house plants. The area was a little tight and those who do not have the courtesy to move over to the side while admiring the plants held up the line. That was my major pet peeve.

The Olympique Stadium was on the opposite side of the road from the Jardin de Botanique. We took some pics along the way. Can't miss the entrance to Jardin de Botanique and there's a huge parking lot. There's information booths with a friendly receptionist that speaks both English and French. Multiple passes to choose from with different rates. If you are a student or resident - you get a discount. We chose Tix 1 where we got the Jardins and Insectorium. Right at the entrance there's a Boutique to buy garden stuff :). You walk in at hit the green houses and Bioderm area. Once again everything was English / French and staff were extremely friendly. We got there about Lunch time so before we ventured to through the gardens we decided to go for lunch at their restaurant. Pricey but did not disappoint. We had fresh roast chicken, salad and brown rice- with a glass of wine. Most people were just enjoying a small pastry and coffee - visiting and reading on their own. We then walked around - first garden the restaurant had a terrace - great for snapping shots. However that was the first one! So be prepared to do a lot of walking. You do have the option to trolley to the end and it's quite the distance so ask about it at the ticket area. There's specific stops and they don't do random stops. Insectorium is a small bug museum - if u like bugs. This place was catering to parties, museums and they do evening festivities. Look it up before you go. Take some bug spray and sunscreen. Also it was unfortunate the Chinese garden was closed and some of the flowers yet to bloom. But overall it was a day to be leisurely and enjoy the greenery!",4,6/4/2016,Rahimah M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zzagn2Xg7sIcPeoP5TZ8OA,"Edmonton, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
744,Great tourist attraction! The Jardin is home to a numerous number of both plants and insects. It's a great place to bring the family and enjoy a leisurely stroll through nature and learn about nature. The insectarium is both fun and a bit creepy but it was great learning about the different types of bugs. The Jardin has a beautiful Chinese garden and has spots for both medicinal and toxic plants. On Saturday they have great activities such as taking part in a tea party. Would recommend to any enthusiast! They gave plenty of cafes and bathrooms too!

752,"My favorite botanical garden is in San Francisco, when you wander down into the wood, surrounded by redwoods and a creek, with nary a city sound whispering through the pines. But this is a close second. To me, a botanical garden is an escape from the city. I'm not really a plant person, despite my love of the botanical garden, but I love the opportunity to wander into my own quiet, and to have a nice view while I do so. This garden did not disappoint. The Chinese garden is a superb example, calming, and almost like I was transported miles and miles east. And its examples of bonzai were phenomenal. Not only did I learn a ton about the work that goes into bonzai, but I simply have to respect a 270 tree that is smaller than a toddler.I also fell in love with the English vertical crevasse garden. Who ever heard of such a thing? Obviously some people, but not me. And now I want one. Thanks a lot, Jardin botanique.When I'm back in Montreal I'll definitely visit again. Sure, my spouse might be left in peaceful repose on a chaise somewhere, but that's okay, I'll get my own city escape, all to myself.",4,6/1/2014,Kristy C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jzV56K7A_mx3y3Eh7YG26g,"Reno, NV",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
753,"Hands down my favorite botanical garden and I've visited every one I have been able to wherever I travel. You have to spend time in the Japanese Gardens -- beautiful! I spent at least 2 hours in the gardens and saw maybe 25% of them. I will definitely visit this again and will set aside at least 4+ hours to walk through. The insectarium is small and has a couple really cool parts -- one being the ant farm. The ant farm shows ants taking food to their habitat -- you can see the ants carrying the pieces of food back and forth. Highly worth a visit (See my Insectarium review for more information).If you come to Montreal (or live in Montreal), this is a must see! Try to make it a cooler day if possible, otherwise wear very comfortable and cool clothes. Although I had the Montreal museum pass (well worth it if you plan on visiting multiple museums), I believe the Insectarium is part of the cost for the Botanical Gardens as the Insectarium is within the gardens.The Gardens are in the same area of the Olympic Stadium, Planetarium, Biodome, and a couple other activities.

754,"Possibly all the reviews slamming the lack of blooming plants are more about people not understanding that seasons act differently in different zones. Remember that you're above the 44th parallel here, so more than likely things will be blooming later than where you live.That said, this is a fantastic place to visit. Yes, the Chinese Garden won't reopen until 2017, but the Japanese Garden is worth spending some contemplative time in.

When I was there, there was a special exhibit going on called Mosaicultures, which was the most impressive topiary exhibit I have ever seen. The Chinese garden also has many lanterns in various forms, shaped like animals or people, which are lit up at night. There are also many greenhouses with different types of plants inside.

If you have trouble walking, please take the mini train! If you're just parking at the Biodome, then it will be a slightly closer walk because the garage is a little closer. The admission for 2 adults was about $40, which we thought was quite high just to view gardens. We are from Boston and our Arboretum is completely free. We visited in August (with what seemed like half the world), and hardly any flowers were in bloom. The green plants were there, but you can only look at so much greenery before you're bored.The best part, in my opinion, were the structures of China in the Chinese garden and the animals sculptures throughout the park.

769,"This review is based on my visit in fall when most of the plants were in hibernation and my personal views as an adult visitor.  I would rate this 4 stars if I took children here.My friend and I visited the Jardin Botanique during the 2015 lantern festival. Most of the shrubbery had gone into hibernation due to the cool weather. I think this is why the Jardin Botanique holds the lantern festival.We were excited to here about the Chinese/Japanese lantern festival. Even though a lot of effort went into putting it together (it's a 1-year process), we thought the displays and the lights were tacky. Many other adults and all of the children loved the display.  What can I say? My friend and I are jaded and have travelled internationally and prefer the real thing.There was a good demonstration of chinese shadow puppetry and the person who talked about it was very knowledgeable.  I would rate that part of the visit 5 stars.I enjoyed looking at the bonsai trees in the Japanese Garden. For some reason, I thought there would be many more bonsais than what I saw there. I found the Japanese Garden to be my favorite part of the gardens in the month of October given that many garden plants go into hibernation when autumn hits Montreal.If I had children, I would rate this as 4-stars. If you're not a child, it's not necessary to visit this attraction if you're short on time and can occupy yourself with other things to do. This attraction was relatively easy to get to using public transit as it is very close to the subway/metro.",2,1/1/2016,Geeta S.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ykcYfhzoSEAwrjoMr5hctQ,"San Francisco, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

783,"The Montreal botanical gardens are rapidly becoming one of my favorite places in the city to visit.   It's one part of the Montreal Space for Life which also includes the Biodome, Insectarium and the Planetarium. It's a 75 hectare National Historic Site of Canada and is considered one of the most important botanical gardens in the world.  Just a short walk from the Pie-IX metro station it's open year round. Containing 22,000 species spread throughout 10 greenhouses and 30 gardens many of which are located outside the place is huge. Montrealers can check out the outside stuff for free.There're special events and exhibitions all year and many of them are actually quite good.  Walk amongst thousands of butterflies in the ""Butterflies Go Free"" exhibit held annually  from February to April. Gardeners will be interested in the annual plant sale held in May. It's worth checking out their website to see all the stuff going on.Open all year, continually changing, educational and family friendly, the only real downside is that tickets can be steep.  Starting at $15 for Quebecers, special events sometimes cost a bit more. The gardens are big enough though that it will take hours to get through just a portion. The International Mosaicultures event currently on until the end of September 2013 runs $25 but the ticket is actually valid for two visits. Of course, the outside bits won't cost you a dime.It's a fun and educational outing that breaks up the monotony of city life and breaks you out of the rut of cocktails, live music, performance art hipster routine.",5,8/8/2013,Chris B.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1lRbzzJ5yXGq6K0CpUCbMw,"Montreal, Canada",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

I would have to say my favorite areas were the lake, the Asian gardens and the tree troll. The troll was a lot more difficult to find than I thought it would be. I wish we had more time to enjoy the park, maybe with a picnic of assorted french cheeses and a nice bottle of wine.    I hope to return in the future and spent more time in the park, it was so lovely and I will remember it until my dieing day. I only wish that I had been fortunate enough to see the temporary topiary show that was at the garden last summer, but all in all I was not disappointed.

786,The Montreal Botanical Garden is beautiful. I'm glad I was able to walk around through the various gardens and appreciate all the flowers in bloom. They have an extensive collection of glass houses filled with exotic plants from all over the world. Quite magnificent. I really loved being able to walk around in nature and take photos. Highly recommend if you are a nature lover. This is next to the Biodome as well - so why not kill 2 birds with one stone if you have the time. (Note: Don't confuse this with the little garden next to the Biosphere which is a different museum. It happens to the best of us!),4,8/11/2012,Caroline K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CBcVLRQBySr3IdjLB5jOwA,"Los Angeles, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal
787,"It is a true gem. I have been coming here since I was a baby and I just cannot get tired of it because they always update, change, add new features, and have special events on the regular basis (like the pumpkins for Halloween, the Chinese lanterns in the fall, the ice sculptures in the winter). If you live in Montreal and own an Accès Montreal card, you get in for free (and the card is just 8$, cheaper than a single ticket to get in). This summer, they had a rich series of concerts at various places around the garden on the weekends: Jazz, tango, classical, pop... Then you just have to sit back in the grass and relax while listening and enjoying the view. These were magic moments. Besides that, the food at the restaurant is very decent but it is on the longer side to wait in line (it is cafeteria style). That being said, when you go spend time there, it usually is because you are not in a rush and ready to take your time, so in that mindset, it is ok to wait. Little kids will enjoy the shuttle ride around the garden and the park near the insectarium. Parents will be happy to find a breastfeeding/ baby feeding/ diaper changing room in the main pavilion near the ticket booths, and changing stations in most bathrooms all around the garden. Easy to access by bus or metro; there is a parking too ($).

793,"Decided to fork out the quite pricey admission fee to visit during the Mosaicultures International and the Garden of Lights. Both of these events are well worth seeing as they are very beautiful displays. The Mosaicultures which ends by the 29th of Sept is made up of about 40 sculptures made from plants basically. Some of them are huge and they are all amazing to view. The Bird Tree took them like 6 years to make, thats how much effort goes in to these. The Garden of Lights is an annual nightly event through the Fall where the Chinese Garden is filled with Lanterns of all different things from animals to warriors and the Japanese Gardens is also lit up. This is also very nice to see. Admission during this time allows you two visits if you were not visiting at a time to see them both or I just passed the ticket on to someone else.Admission also includes entry to the Insectarium which is interesting but didn't take me more than 30mins to explore. During the year when these events are not on, admission is cheaper but still a little expensive so you would really have to appreciate the gardens to pay the fee. The Gardens are quite big and you could spend a few hrs just wandering the paths all the way to the other end where the Tree House and arboretum is and the green houses are quite good.Overall, if you're going during these events be prepared for lots of people but otherwise pick a nice day and enjoy the gardens.",4,9/20/2013,Kylie P.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=voDqNNoB-9KLlczLhRqStA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

Here I thought Atlanta had a pretty decent-sized garden for being stuck in the middle of a city, but leave it to Canada to show us up in all the right ways. The Japanese and Chinese gardens here were highly impressive - you almost feel like you're walking through an Asian festival with all of the lanterns and artwork! The other areas were nice as well, and there's really quite a lot to see. If it's a plant or flower known to science, it's bound to be here somewhere. Between all of the paths, green houses, and gazebos, it's easy to get lost and lose track of time in this nature wonderland stuck between the concrete jungle outside.I remember it being a little expensive, but it certainly was worth every penny. I didn't even get to see the entire thing (I walked a good 3/4 of the place though) and would love to come back and experience the rest in the spring versus the fall when I went.

The Chinese gardens were probably the most beautiful part of the park, and we could have easily spent the whole day here, but since we were only in Montreal for a week we had to move quickly, especially since we slept in and half of the day was already over. The park is huge and it has indoor greenhouse gardens that are loaded with beautiful flowers. The BF is a bit of a queer *cough* I mean gardener, so he was pointing out the flowers by all their Latin names and throwing random factoids at me about what makes each plant so special which was like being back in biology 101. Annuals, semi-annuals, bulbs... I don't care as long as they look pretty! On special occasions I am required to buy him flowers! How does that work?! If you have the time, you should definitely check out the Jardin Botanique de Montreal.

I am not exaggerating.My friend and I went last year during in the early fall when they had all the lanterns in the Chinese Gardens. It was absolutely beautiful. The Chinese Garden's themselves is quite a sight to see as well, and it is quite spacious. Another thing we enjoyed were the vegetable gardens. There was literally every kind of food that comes from the ground being grown there: vegetables, herbs, fruits... we were tempted to swipe an onion to include with our dinner feast later that night but there are signs all over telling us that they take vegetable theft very seriously so we ended up not doing it. I recommend that anyone visiting (or living in) Montreal go check this out at least once, as kit was one of the more pleasurable non-nightlife experiences on my trip.*Tip* Wear comfortable shoes.

800,"I recently visited for the Chinese Lanterns. Although I did not get to visit the entire place, the Chinese Lanterns were breathtaking.  If you want to get great photos, of course your first thought is to go when it's dark out.  This is true, somewhat.  The perfect time is to go right before the sun sets.  Comparing the photos I took, the images when it was still somewhat light out came out much better than the night ones (although I did get some nice ones).There was also a ""Little Monsters"" section for the kids. Of course, I am a kid at heart and ran through myself.The rating lacks 2 stars because I was a little mislead about the Chinese Lanterns.  One the website and the brochure, it mentions ""The Lanterns in Music"".  When reading that, I expected to see was the story of the Emperor (the theme this year) told to music....instead, after waiting around for 45 minutes, we found out that it was just music in one of the little areas....NOTHING to do with the actual lanterns.

The butterflies were beautiful are released in the greenhouse and would sometimes land on your clothes.

It's rose season and it's absolutely gorgeous in the gardens, all types of flowers were blossoming.

It's a great relaxing hike in the Arboretum area when not too hot and plenty of people relaxes on the grass next to the water and otherwise. It's quite stunning and you really could spend many hours here exploring the different types of flora and plants. The Insectarium is relatively small, but fun, I got to hold an insect resembling a leaf (harmless) while the staff taught us interesting facts.

This only happens every four years and each time in a different country so if you ever want to go to the gardens it should be now! The gardens from each country were very beautiful and full of meaning... we had a guide (can get a free guide in the morning) but the plaques near each garden tell the stories of each garden well. It is more busy on the weekend so go on the weekday if you can and either go early or in the later afternoon. Also - your entry fee gets you into the insectarium which you can visit on a separate day - my 2.5 yr old nephew really loved both the gardens and the insectarium so it was well worth it!

824,"It's a gorgeous summer day and you're looking for a place to catch a break and get away...to avoid the crushing crowds of the First Friday food truck crowds, to read a book at one of the dozens of adirondack chairs hiding under the beautiful trees, to be able to stop and smell the (many many varieties of lovely) roses (literally)....then this is your place.  It'll set you back about $20 CD, but well worth it.  The highlights: the Chinese garden, friendly and helpful staff, foxes roaming the grounds (they come out when things start to shut down), and just the peaceful and quiet beauty and happy, relaxed people visiting (oh, and you're one of them!) :) Didn't have time to check out the insectarium or greenhouse....but saving that for my next visit.  Definitely worth spending some time here.  (Note on the foxes: just don't feed 'em and don't get too comfortable with 'em, one looked a little too tame and got a little bit bold with a kid at one of the playgrounds, approaching him awfully closely...no harm done, but still, they're wild...)",5,7/4/2015,Eugene K.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fWemR2gQcS8IhkPzD0Zdzg,"Philadelphia, PA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

My husband and I had purchased the Montreal Museum pass the day before for $50 a piece. They get you into pretty much anything in the city. Well, my husband, managed to lose his. He ended up retracing our steps (in the bitter cold) only to end up empty-handed. So I used my pass and had my cash out for him.

834,"This is a beautiful botanical garden.  When we were here w/ friends several years ago there was a tram that took us around so we saw a lot more of it than we did yesterday because there was no tram.  Last time we walked through the Chinese Garden and the Japanese Garden plus saw beautiful and interesting plants and trees from the tram.  Yesterday we walked to and through the Chinese Garden, admiring the roses in bloom along the way.  Currently there is a special annual lantern festival that will be open until the end of the month.  This is its 19th year and it commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Chinese Garden.  The spectacle takes months to plan, w/ the plans being drawn up in Montreal and sent to Singapore, where the lanterns are fabricated.  The completed lanterns are sent back to Montreal, where they are assembled, wired and put in place.  The theme of this year's display is the reign of the first Emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi and his cavalry, but there are also mythical, magical creatures like dragons amid the foliage.  Lanterns are set up throughout the Chinese Garden, in the ponds and amongst the plants.  The Botanical Garden stays open later, until 9PM, for the occasion and I would imagine the lanterns are even more impressive after dark than they were in the daylight.  There are bilingual signs explaining the significance of the display and the items in it.  The Garden itself is lovely and tranquil w/o the lanterns, w/ stone ""windows"" set in the walls looking out of the garden and walkways paved in intricate patterns of pebbles and stones.  As we left the Chinese Garden I could smell the roses, even though they weren't visible from the gateway.  There is much more to see than we saw this time but it is a beautiful garden that is worth several hours time, regardless of the season.  Just wear comfortable walking shoes, take your camera and wear sunscreen.",4,10/11/2011,Toni M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UXbCcmkYGl3DH_Py5UOtbQ,"El Cerrito, CA",Jardin Botanique de Montréal

It drew crowds of outrageous proportions; I don't know how people physically stood on the snaking ticketing line in the blazing sun for hours (My group had pre-purchased tickets online and were able to go on the express line, waiting only 5 minues). Once inside the garden, it was very hard to walk around and enjoy the works of art when there were so many people (there was literally no elbow room). They were beautiful works, though. For this particular day's experience, I would give it 3 stars, but I know that in essence, the garden deserves more respect. We saw half of the Mosaicultures works because the crowds tired us out, and did not get to see the Gardens of Light exhibit due to fatigue (it would've been nicer to view after dusk, anyway).

The indoor gardens are gorgeous too with lots of exotic orchids and other beautiful tropical flowers. The staff is helpful and unobtrusive. The grounds are well maintained and many areas have bathrooms available. My only complaint is that the gift shop is rather small and really did not offer much in terms of souvenirs.

They are sponsored by various associations within Canada and by other countries. The Chinese garden especially was also beautiful, peaceful, and interesting. Beautiful bonsai in the Japanese garden (and in the Chinese, but called something different there). We easily spent several hours walking the circuit. Many people seemed to be picnicking. If you are into gardening there is much more to explore. They have a garden devoted to vegetables, an alpine garden, and one devoted to new plants on the commercial home market. You can combine entries to the Biodome, Olympic Tower, and/or Insectarium - look online to figure it out before you wait on line, and in fact buy your tickets ahead of time so you don't need to wait (though the line moved okay, for us).

There is a beautiful out door area to have a bite and take a dip in the sauna. I don't know why a prestigious club would have dirt scum bobbles in the water. You just feel like running in to the shower after going in. Can't say it was a relaxin experience. Once I sat down out side for brunch, the menu was quite pricy but we are at A prestigious club and if you can afford the membership costs them paying 11.00 for two sunny side up eggs and a few fruits is fine. Now you'd expect great service right ? Wrong !  It took 40 min to get out order and the place was empty. Then once we finally got the meal. I can't say anything about the food itself. It was sunny side up eggs hard to mess that up and the fruits were fresh. The bread was multigrain, maybTu pense que j ai pas de peine moi? Que je n ai pas de sensibilité ? Pourtant tu commence a me connaitre et a savoir comme je suis une personne sensibele that why the meal was an extra 5.00 ;) Having been in the pool and wearing a bathing suit I asked for more coffee and when she poured it, she didn't both moving or taking the cup.  She poured the coffee me , not a drop it was a lot!

865,"I have discovered a deep vein of neglected yelping here for myself as I seem to have neglected a bunch of my favourite parks! Fun fact about me, I didn't learn to ride a bike properly until I was in my 20s, and only then did I finally get out to really explore some of the incredible bike paths in our city, which have only been getting more and more exceptional in recent years. One awesome ride is to connect the big downtown parks, looping around from the mountain, laurier, la fontaine and then our here to Maisonneuve. Maisonneuve is realllllllly fun to bike, it's a great big green expanse with gorgeous paths, you really feel simultaneously so free and quite protected from cars and things - perfect if you're still gaining comfort as a biker. You can get up close and personal with that weird icon of architecture, the Big O, and there's stadiums tucked near by where you can watch some of the best Roller Derby bouts (when they reopen, le sigh!) If you're out enjoying the parks, just maintain that 2 meter safety zone and bring your mask and we can all help each other feel a little more safe in these bonkers times.",4,6/30/2020,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Parc Maisonneuve

In a city where the action never stops, the horns and sirens honk and blare it's important to have green space as a sense of sanctuary for the people to relax in nature and find peace whether it's to have kids run around, a picnic or just chill under a tree. For those that see people dining in the park with picnic baskets its a clever idea from Triple Crown dinette. I'm actually surprised no other restaurants in the area have caught onto the idea also. It's rather ingenious. Sometimes a few creepy characters hanging around but if you mind your P's and Q's they shouldn't bother you.

885,"We were here specifically for a music festival, so we didn't get time to wander the trails, sit on benches, or otherwise meander through the park itself. Still, I feel like we saw enough of it to be duly impressed.To start, the park is pretty massive. I hadn't realized, going in, that it would be quite so spread out. We took the metro in to the park's station, and I saw a lot of kids on board. I thought to myself, ""Those are some rad parents, bringing their kids to a festival like this, introducing them to good music!"" But a lot of the kids ended up going to the other end of the park upon leaving the metro station, which I found amusing. Sure, there were some kids that were at the festival (more than I had expected), but the ones from our train on the metro walked in the opposite direction from the festival grounds.And the festival grounds, themselves, were massive as well. The festival had two main stages and two side stages, and they were spread out enough that you didn't have to worry about a band from one stage overpowering the band on the other stage (side stages, that is; they didn't have the two main stages going at the same time, of course).There were a ton of little shaded areas where people could kick back in the shade, and the festival organizers had spiffed those spaces up with hammocks and WiFi hotspots, which was a nice touch.The paths between the main and side stages were dirt and rock, but that was manageable. It got a bit dusty with all the people walking to and fro, but again, it wasn't terrible. There were small patches of grass and picnic tables near the main stages, as well, which were nice for those who needed a place to rest during the day. I know we didn't experience everything the park has to offer, but we were there for twelve hours that day, and did a lot of walking. We could see the Biodome from our spot near the main stages, and were able to enjoy a nice view of trees and lush surroundings from that vantage point, as well.I think the thing that impressed me the most is what I touched on at the top of this review: that the park was able to handle a large festival while still keeping part of it open for families and kids to enjoy, without the two being on top of each other, is impressive. I would have liked to have gone back to explore the non-festival part of the park, but our schedules didn't allow for that, alas.

889,"This is a beautiful and serene location.  It's a park on an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence River.  And, from this smaller, though not small, island (Ile Sainte-Helene), one looks across at the much bigger island that is the Ile de Montreal.The whole layout is interesting.  First, it is accessed by car from ramps from the Pont Jacques-Cartier, as the bridge changes form from a cantilevered structure to a simple bridge structure on the other side of this island as it connects with the south shore.  Then, the Metro also services this park.  As it crosses the river from Montreal to the south shore, it makes one intermediate stop on the island and the station is called Jean-Drapeau.I have only seen it during autumn colors, and it is mostly quiet, but it is a must-see attraction in Montreal.  There are views at its perimeter, ponds, ducks, squirrels, water features, grassy knolls, forested areas, and some structures such as an aquatic complex, the Biosphere, and an expensive restaurant called Helene de Champlain.  Also, from the Jean-Drapeau metro stop on the island, one can easily walk to the Casino de Montreal, on adjacent Ile de Notre-Dame, or take a hop on a city bus line which continuously shuttles between this metro stop and the casino. (That 3 day STM pass works for all of these treks).Calling this island Parc Jean-Drapeau is interesting and maybe slightly amusing.  It is a commemoration of Montreal's late spendthrift mayor who brought Expo 67, the Metro, and the Olympics to the city.  Jean-Drapeau's mark is everywhere.  He even had a sense of humor.  When questioned about Toronto's upstaging Montreal as the economic engine of Canada, he said:  ""Let Toronto become Milan, we will always be Rome.""  That made for a good belly laugh.",4,5/14/2013,Robert G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,"Clackamas County, OR",Parc Jean-Drapeau

My biggest complaint would be that there aren't enough clearly delineated sidewalks or roads for pedestrians. We were basically walking in the road for much of our time there, trying to avoid cars. Since the Biosphere was closed (closes at 5pm), the main attraction was the casino which was more fun than I expected. It looked like kind of a happening Saturday night date place for middle aged couples. There's a bus that takes you straight to the casino right next to the metro station which I thought was really nice.

The run there and back (to the city) is around a good 15km, but you get to see the beautiful river, the park, and all the industrial stuff on the south side too. I've been on this run several dozen times and I have just touched the surface of its beauty. Right next to the park is a race track.

I live in Pointe-Saint-Charles and love waking up early (6am) to bike along the Canal Lachine until I reach this destination. For me, the best feeling is arriving in the empty park and joining the birds as they do their morning chirping thing. What a privilege!! I always stop at the West-most point of the park to sit on a park bench, eat a banana, and watch the waters of the Saint Lawrence River. On a calm, quiet, and clear morning this is perfection. I usually take the opportunity to think about something while I do this and then often feel the need to get back on the move after 10-15 minutes (so I'm still waiting for my epiphany of thought during these sessions). Anyway, my real point is this: Parc Rene-Levesque is a wonderful investment of time into happiness. A little time (10-15 minutes) really helps me win my day. I am so grateful that we all have access to this precious public resource.To give a sense of proportion: Lachine is on of the very few areas outside of my beloved Pointe-Saint-Charles neighbourhood that I've thought of moving to.

The park, and I mean all of it (look on google maps for the entire size), is filled with dog poop. I mean everywhere. Take one step and you've stepped in some, take another step and... low and behold you've stepped in some more again.I am not kidding. The park is not clean and I was disgusted by this that I did not want to sit on the ground to have my picnic. Thank god we found a bench because there was absolutely no way I'd be able to sit and eat.My reasoning for the two stars is that if you expect people to come to a public park, at least clean it.I understand if there was dog poop here and there but literally everywhere?

(Seriously Plateau yuppies and Mile End hipsters, get out of your shells sometime...) Parc Rene Levesque is one of the more special ones, in that it is a peninsula created from landfill (like  Ile Ste-Helene and Parc Jean Drapeau), but the landscape artists did a super job making the sculptures and the waterfront views the highlights of this peninsula park. On one side, it faces Kahnawake and on the other side, it faces the old Lachine village, the Lachine marina and the beginning of the Lachine Canal. This place is always filled with roller-bladers, cyclists and families out enjoying the day. Not sure if it's still going, but there used to be a ferry that ran between the tip of the park to the Lachine Village (in front of the Dairy Queen).I find Montreal, while it has its share of sculptured public art, comes no where near as close the amounts of public sculptures and statues you see in cities like New York, Toronto or even Chicago.

928,"Cannot believe that me, someone who reviews like every park ever...has NOT reviewed this park yet?!  This is but one of a few serious head scratchers I've come across recently. We're fixin that right now.So this park is technically actually ginormous and constitutes the whole entire LaSalle Blvd riverside park from the Verdun border (Parc l'Honorable Georges O'Reilly) all the way to Parc de l'Aqueduc. I've tried numerous times, to no avail, to find some other hidden park name throughout this vast space, but so far nada. Particularly though, the spot you really wana check out in this park, and the reason it deserves more than all 5 stars, is the bird sanctuary island: at the corner of 6th/7th avenue and Blvd LaSalle. The rapids are intimidatingly astonishing and close enough to drown in here and the whole tiny island is full of different birds and sometimes other wildlife. Great picnic options, great photo options, extremely relaxing, beautiful and enjoyable! Bikes are not permitted on the island and must be parked at the bike rack at the entrance, so bring your bike lock. (There are still A-HOLES that don't respect this and think it's fine to walk their bikes through, but please don't be like those ppl - you'll disturb the bird habitats and make it difficult to walk around each other on the path as well as cause traffic). It's a beautiful spot to bird watch, practice photography, do yoga, picnic or to enjoy the rapids in all their glory without getting wet (necessarily). It's an excellent, well worth the price tag of ZERO, activity for the whole family or the couple in love to enjoy.Up until recently dogs were not allowed in any part of this park, now pooches are allowed in the park by the riverside, but still not allowed to bring your furchildren with you on the sanctuary island at 6th avenue (for obvious reasons). I have taken many many photos at my stops at this park so let them speak for me. I will leave it at this: if u live in Mtl, or if ur visiting Mtl and you believe Parc Lafontaine etc. is impressive or worth your time, and you have not yet discovered this park: it is DEFINITELY worth making the trek over, you have definitely been missin out on somethin' special.Of course I say that knowing one day I'll be b*tching that the spot got too popular and ppl are ruining it. *le sigh* Enjoy with respect folks okodoki?!",5,5/17/2019,Kandi R.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CLfqC-AQJLkmOHV3d-KCZg,"La Salle, Canada",Parc des Rapides

931,"This is Montreal's ""other"" Park.While many have already written about and described and visited Montreal's Mont Royal Park, I'd like to divert people's attention to another of Montreal's park's and the better one in my opinion as well.The Parc des Rapides is located in the southern Montreal borough of Lasalle and without a car, it's not all that difficult to get to. Just go to De L'Eglise Metro station (Green Line) and catch the 58 ouest. Better yet, jump on the Verdun bike path which runs along the river and it will literally take you there.A giant bird sanctuary, thunderous, roaring river rapids, adventurous kayakers, Stand-Up Paddling in the basin, fly-fishing, families out for the day, photographers, couples making out in the bushes, students studying under a shade of the tree, painters, random landscape sculptures, you will literally find it all here. I actually prefer this park to Mont Royal because of the dramatic setting in the middle of the St. Lawrence River and the crashing white water rapids all around you. It just somehow feels cooler and you feel you're nowhere near the city. The landscape designers have done a stellar job here of interspersing the trees, bushes, flowers, and sculptures. You're bound to find your own little place somewhere here to just chill, pic-nic, read a book or meditate. Pack a lunch and come here and if you didn't, no worries, there's a great Italian restaurant across the street as well as an ice-cream bar. Come here, chill, relax, watch the ducks, geese, herons and other birds. Montreal may be one of the unique cities in the world which is located close-by to white river rapids so  why not come check it out?

There are biking paths that connect the island to Ile Sainte Helene through the ice braking bridge running along Champlain Bridge, as well as biking paths going to Lachine cannal.Snow cleaning and collection during the winter is well organized and may be one of the best in Montreal (difficult to compete with Westmount).Best part is kids play on my street during every season.

There are so many things they can do and it can make for a great family outing.- There's a free animal farm with lots of animals to see such as goats, horses, cows, chickens, roosters, pigs, ponies, mules and so forth. They look like they are taken care of well enough and kids and adult both like to see them.- There's a casse-croute/fast-food joint near the lake. They serve a variety of fast food items such as hot dogs, hamburgers, pogos, fries and so forth. Their menu also has a few more things that clearly caters to kids as well as unprepared parents. :)- Lake has lots of activities. During the summer, canoes can be rented, during the winter you can go skating on the lake.- Plenty of places to plop down onto the grass and have a family picnic.- Lots of trails to be enjoyed and some parts are particularly enjoyable. There's a reason why this place is well known for wedding photos and seeing more than your fair share of brides and grooms walking around.- Huge play park for kids in front of the Farm. Lots of kids here and it can be pretty chaotic... but that's how kids like it, right? :)Cons :- If you're not so much into kids, you may want to avoid some areas during the weekends, there are really A LOT of kids. Some areas may be quiet enough to be enjoyed however if you look well enough.- While their casse-croute/fast food joint has nothing that truly stands out, kindly note the wait time is pretty bad. 20+ minutes to prepare me a couple of hot dogs, pogos and fries? Sup?- Parking is 7$. While contributing to the park is nice and all, it's a bit expensive. So, if you're able to park somewhere nearby freely on the residential streets and bring your stuff to the park, you'll save a bit. You are planning to do a lot of walking anyways, right? What's 10 minutes more going to do?",5,9/10/2014,Jason M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,"Laval, Montreal, Canada",Centre de la Nature

There is a building where people can rest and go to the restrooms. There was a hockey tournament going on last weekend, kids join in the fun to win a look-alike Stanley cup. There were free hot dogs stand and free hot drinks from Tim Hortons. I didn't really get a chance to see around because it was way too cold to just walk around to look but I see a board where they specify they offer boat activities, hiking, and biking path.

It's our first time coming since  La Grande Roue de Montreal was built. It is a great attraction, and there's something of interest for the whole family which is great. You can walk and sit along the old port and look at the beautiful views that stretches over 2km along the Saint Lawrence River. We also love the street vendors, good prices and unique stuff.

I was bored and told myself, you haven't been downtown in such a long time, so I decided to go to the old port. I went to the clock tower where I decided to go all the way up on too, approximately 281 steps, going up was not so bad, but coming that was a whole other story. But if you do try bring your camera as there is exceptional views from up there.Great restaurant, always many street players, they also have la Grande Roue now which is open even during winter. In the summer you can swing you way over the old port. Many activities for all age.

948,"I'm not entirely sure what's so different about this Yelp listing and the one for Old Montreal, as the lines seem to blur. So I'm not going to wax too poetic here, just in case I'm describing the same thing as that other Yelp page without the word ""port"" in it.But that's the main different to me, is that this is all about that port, and even though all of old Montreal sort of has the moniker of ""Old Port"" that we're dealing with the port part specifically.To be honest, it's still the tale of two ports. Yes, there's the area with all the trinket stands, and the massive aerial playground and the zipline and the paddleboats and the droves of tourists. But I was just wandering around and had the other area of the port with locals walking dogs, jogging, and some really incredibly lovely park-like bits near the water, with ponds, fountains, ducks, walkways, and wonderful flowers.I stood there and looked out across the water and saw the funky architecture, and I watched a boat take off into the river, and it felt like a very port-y experience so separate from the commercial side.

Parking there is really hectic good luck to anybody trying to find a spot, my advice to you ditch the car take the metro or a uber.The best part of the old port is the cobble stone they have so many great little streets you can walk down and feel like you're in a little city in Europe. The fireworks are the main attraction I would say and they go off at 10 pm sharp so if you want a great spot go early, personally I always find a great spot away from the crowd and always have a great view.

958,"The Old Port is definitely turning Into the SF version of Fishermans wharf. Unfortunately every city does have it's must visit places. Many tour guides and hotel concierges must send tourists here in droves. It's a place to see some of the oldest part of Montreal. This is the main draw. The cobblestone streets are unlike many other places you see in a canada (other than Quebec City).   The place however is becoming more and more tacky with horse and carriage tour people all over and your typical nick knack tourist shops. I guess it's the inevitability of having demand for lots of foot traffic. There are some wonderful historic places. You can learn about the early history of Montreal and marvel in the old buildings.  A good selection of amazing restaurants and also some interesting courtyard patios within the restaurants all over the place and wonderful boutique hotels. However I could do without the zipline and decor that I believe makes the place look like an amusement park. Here are some abbreviated tips on some of the many restaurants and hotels:Jardin Nelson- albeit expensive is a great place to come for brunch on a sunny day to enjoy some of the jazz and enjoy a few drinks in their unique courtyard terrace. Gibbys is Fantastic for Steak and I'd declare one of the best steakhouses in the city.The keg - two of them here are your staples for Steak at a dinner to expect to cost $40-$50 pp. Olive and Gourmando- although not eaten there, this is the supposed expensive trendy tourist place for lunch. Modavie, Gaspar and  le Chapagnerie are all gourmet and delicious with different menus. The two top boutique hotels are the St. James- it's been whispered through the grapevine that when Madonna is in town she reserves a whole floor for her and the entourage she travels with. Hotel Nelligan is upscale elegant and very impressive if high end hotels are your budget. The Westin, W and Intercontinental are a bit further walk away but not unreasonable. Just make sure you are able to walk a bit longer. If not, it's always easy to take a cab down. Sure tourists come here in droves and it's understood. Parking is always hellaciously difficult (on the street) and if you park in a city lots is $16 for the day which is gouging in my mind. Overall the place is a 3.5 for me but perhaps I'm somewhat jaded as it's becoming a tad more boring for a local.",3,9/13/2015,D'Arcy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,"Terrebonne, Canada",Le Vieux-Port de Montréal

Coming by metro is long and labourous.

975,"If you have but one day to visit Montreal, this is the one spot you must visit. The Old Port (also known as Old Montreal) is the historic, old part of the city, and it contains all of Montreal's most historic sites and buildings. Take the time to read the plaques affixed to most edifices, as you will get a free history class! There are old museums (and some new ones as well!), and narrow cobblestoned streets (ladies, don't wear high heels!), and gorgeous old stone architecture. Walking down the old streets - especially at night, when the area is illuminated and takes on a magical glow - one truly feels as if one is in an old, old section of Paris. It feels like old Europe. I've never gotten the sense of an authentic, French , historic area outside of France. Certainly not anywhere in the States. And this is precisely why Montreal is unique.Caleches (horse-drawn carriages) are always a-plenty here, night and day. Many of their carriages are ornately bedecked with flowers.There are tons of touristy tchotchke shops here on the main drag (lovely Rue St. Paul), but there are also wonderful restaurants, bistros, art galleries, artists' quarters, ivied courtyards, narrow cobblestoned alleyways hidden off the larger roads, musicians and artists out painting and performing, and more. Central to the are is Place Jacques Cartier, bordered by outdoor terrasses and bistros and gorgeous, imposing old buildings (including old City Hall). To get a feel of life back in the 1600s, you can visit the adjacent Chateau Ramsey, housed in a real home from the 17th century. Bonsecours Market is right off the square as well (note: there are a lot of nice, clean public bathrooms here), as are old churches and more courtyards.  Of course, bordering the whole area is the Port of Montreal and the waterfront. They have really beautified the waterfront in the past ten years or so, and it's very walkable now. One area has food trucks, and there is a long strip of restaurants and shops and vendors, with a large eating area at the base of Rue. St. Laurent. I especially like how they demarcated the streets with large, vertical street signs, and I was also impressed by how they incorporated bike paths and walking trails all along this waterfront strip.There is an impressive, contemporary Museum of Architecture at one end of the waterfront promenade, on Place d'Youville, and a block further lies Gibby's, a wonderful, elegant steakhouse housed in a 200-year old stable building. At night, this whole area is bustling until the wee hours of the morning, due to all the cafes, bistros, clubs and bars. Pedestrians will be out strolling late too, as the stores are open late on weekends and especially in the summer. It'll be hopping even after midnight with young native Montreal's going out clubbing or to hear jazz musicians at The Red Piano.

977,"So yes, walk up and down Place Jacques Cartier, as this is pretty much the touristy hub of Montreal but also adorable and joyful in brief tastes if you're local. The narrow cobblestone alleys that lead off the pedestrian square are pretty and tucked with the usual tshirts and maple candy, their real virtue in them is in leading to the further stretches of the Old Port where there are art galleries and better restaurants and boutiques with higher end designers. If you walk along the water towards the west you can see the giant old grain storage and the speakers on the shore that let you hear your voice echo around the empty old icons of industry. Eat a lobster roll, check out the crazy architecture across the water from back when Montreal was a 60s stoner dream of what the future would look like. I suggest starting from Champ de Mars Metro and then Walking up McGill to Square Victoria but anyway you do it just get lost in there, have some wine and cheese, have fun.",4,8/4/2013,Risa D.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Lac-Supérieur, Canada",Le Vieux-Port de Montréal

987,"It seems like a world away and forever ago, but I experienced the Old Port during the middle of winter. Yep, *that* winter. Luckily, during my time there, the city was experiencing a heat wave of near forty-degree temps. I'm not being a smart-a$$. This past winter was brutal. 40 was warm. Being a long-time Chicagoan, the temps didn't bother me in the least. I'd heard about the Old Port and I wanted to have at it.Like most cities that are built for the cold, Montreal was able to showcase the best of the Old Port without batting an eye. I was absolutely charmed by the cobblestone, bridges, light shows, installations, skating rink, and music. The entire port area was filled with people taking pictures, going on walks, sight seeing, and taking in the fun of a winter wonderland. Walking along the frozen water, I spent a lot of time lost in thought and appreciating the stillness. Yep, despite the kids shrieking (in a good way) at the skating rink and the 'thoom thoom thoom' of the bass as the electronica played on, the quiet beauty of the environment fully enveloped me and I walked through the waterways to attempt to take it all in.With plenty of shops nearby, hot chocolate at the ready and Old Montreal waiting to welcome you, the Old Port gladly gives a taste of Old World life in North America. Living in Miami and coming to this part of Montreal, I felt as though I had time traveled. This is a good thing.

It features some really beautiful architecture, as well as a great view of the saint Lawrence river. The architecture reminds me of the small villages in southern France. We wandered aimlessly looking in shop windows and all the smaller art galleries featuring the work of many well known artists.    At one point it started to rain so we dipped into one of the many patio restaurants on the main drag and had a quick drink while we waited for the rain to subside. After the rain let up we continued our walk soaking in the sights and sounds.

The location was superb.  So after walking by in the afternoon, I decided to head back with my spouse.  They have a very nice casual sitting area to the right with comfy couches.  The night was beautiful so the atmosphere was great with the cool night air and the Latin dance beat playing overhead. We got there at 9:15 and there were 7 tables ... so not too busy.  First they didn't bring us a menu for a full 10 minutes, so I finally gave up, hailed one of the waiters and asked for the menu.  Then we watched him head back to the bar, clean up, do something on the computer and load up drinks for the table next to us and still no menu.  After shooting him a couple of looks, he finally brought it almost 20 minutes after we had arrived.  In retrospect, this was the missed moment when we should have gotten up and left. Everything after that was poor service. Yes our waitress was nice but when you ignore us and prioritize bussing a table to bringing us our check, I don't really care if you're friendly. The chicken sandwich was yummy, but the mojito needed more authenticity.  I wouldn't come again although if they had a dance floor to go along with their Latin dance music, I might swing by for a night out... as long as it didn't involve table waiting or watered down mojitoes.",1,5/27/2015,Roxanne M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-yWRu63UPP_f6PZ3WaUX1g,"Silver Spring, MD",Le Vieux-Port de Montréal

Make sure you taste some maple syrup & ice wine along the road!Some tips if you are driving:- Pay CLOSE attention to the signage. At the very least, know the French words for the days of the week so you know when you can and cannot park in a particular spot.- If you park along the parking meters, take note of your parking spot letter & number and go pay at the machine nearby.

This part of town houses most of the historical buildings in the city, and runs alongside the piers on the St. Lawrence River.It's a great place to hang out during the day. You can visit all the tourist attractions and admire the architecture of the historical structures. There are tons of fancy art shops along the streets for you to check out. It's also nice to walk or run along the water while the sun is out. This was part of one of my running routes, going through the Old Port to Ile Saint Helene and back. During the night, it's a great place to admire the city lights as well as for stargazing. The lights from the city blends with the stars, lightly illuminating the historical buildings and giving off a quaint sense of relief. I always walk around there at night when I need some room to breathe and some private time just to ponder about life. In the Winter season, there's a skating rink there worth checking out. It costs more than Parc La Fontaine (which is free) but they usually have better ice and awesome music selection.

1019,"Seriously?  A business listing for a whole city?  Really?  Wow!Well since it's here I guess I'll go ahead and review Old Montreal while the whole experience is still fresh in my little dinosaur sized pebble brain...After driving for over 10 hours from the DC area to Montreal, visiting Old Montreal feels like my car magically sprouted wings and crossed the Atlantic at some supersonic speed.  I could rub my eyes and pinch myself, but my senses and aforementioned little brain would still tell me, ""Hey fatty, you're in some European town...check out the history!  The sites!  The smell of the food and the little outdoor cafes!""To which I'd reply to my brain, ""Hey, shut up you!  I'll teach you to think on your own...here, have a tasty cerveza!""""Cerveza!  Yes!  YES!  YES!!  Give me more fat boy! Umm ummm umm...*""And then the voices in my head would slowly quell until they altogether ceased.  And me sitting there with an impish smile and trace signs of drool pooling at the edge of a grin...as North America fades away into the background of common sense and I give into the notion that I am indeed in Europe.Old Montreal is a mix of the old, the new and the very ""Oui Oui"".  Walk for 5 minutes and you're bound to leave the old cobble stone streets to a newer more modern area as if to encase the historical pedigree of Montreal with a wall of high rise buildings and corporate letters.  Walk another five minutes and you'll pass through the Chinatown arch with colorful reminders of yet another culture that is part of the Montreal melting pot.There is so much to see, so much to do and so so much to eat.  I just wish that I had a little more time in this city to enjoy a tasty brew at an outdoor table or to slowly sip a small cup of espresso as the citizens and tourists danced the dance of pedestrian life flowing between here, there and who knows where...That my friends, is what Montreal means to me.  :-)",4,8/17/2010,Antonio M.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=EbjbpnWTq6G0RgI3VDRatw,"Washington, DC",Le Vieux-Port de Montréal

1028,"I'm not here to review the Old Port as a tourist attraction. As a spot to visit, the Old Port is great. It's bustling in the summer, quaint in the winter. Things get a bit pricey, but you can go for the charm, it's free! And who can resist a labyrinth, regardless of the cost?Instead, I'd like to review a function of the Old Port that folks often forget about, the fact that it is also a show venue. Les Quais du Viex-Port is a section of the Old Port that sometimes gets turned into a concert stage. This might be great for summer events and free shows. However, I'm not so convinced about how it gets converted into an entrance-fee venue. I saw Björk perform there a couple of years ago, and it was fantastic, but let's face it, that's because it was Björk. Aside from the musical component, the ""venue"" is just a flat gravel surface surrounded by a makeshift fence. Not exactly ideal ambiance for more intimate gigs. I decided to write this review because I'll be seeing Portishead play at les Quais du Vieux-Port in October. While I'm thrilled about the show, as the trip-hop defining band have not been here since 1998, I'm not so thrilled about the venue. Add to that the fact that it's an outdoor show in October in Montreal? I'll pray that the music gods look kindly on us and spare us the rain or temperatures hovering around Zero. Portishead will put cartoon stars and hearts in my eyes.

If you manage to get a patio seat at one the restaurants on Place Jacques-Cartier you can even take in a show presented to you by street performers.Art lovers can give their wallets a good workout at any of the many galleries that line up along Rue Notre-Dame.The Basilica Notre-Dame is a must see for only $5 and for another $5 you can catch the light show which I hear is very beautiful.If you tire of walking there are horse carriages waiting to whisk you away on a tour of the old town, the car drivers stuck behind it won't enjoy it so much however. :)There is so much more to do, including the old port, but the above is a good start.",5,8/12/2008,Roger G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Y7KCDbDjtQy-Xr2IBeUWJQ,"Washington, DC",Le Vieux-Port de Montréal

1052,Carre St Louis or Square St Louis is my favourite park in Montreal.  In any of the three seasons (minus winter as I never come here in the cold) it's absolutely idyllic!  It's Montreal's version of Bryant Square park but much nicer!  There is a very cool fountain in the middle and majestic old trees that provide shade and allow for cover from the sun! The houses that line the park speak to the old world architechtue that is quite prevalent and well kept in Montreal.  I imagine in my mind many poets and artists living here but rather it's probably urban professionals.    Unfortunately there are many sketchy characters (some homeless) and young individuals partaking in a toke of weed/pot or drink in the park which is rather unfortunate.  It would be nicer (and safer feeling) without the seedy people.  The pot people don't bother me it's the other individuals.  However if you don't make eye contact they pretty much stay to themselves!  This would make it a 5/5 for me if it was cleaned up but for some this is probably their home!  I'd let my daughter roam freely if different however I keep her close by.  Come stroll on a wonderful blue sky day or come as the leaves change  Open your imagination and relax as you stroll through!,4,9/27/2014,D'Arcy L.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=41kMyI1BfOTyIIAenUSaTQ,"Terrebonne, Canada",Square Saint-Louis

The area is worth a long stroll and bench sitting.  A pedestrian walk sits to the west of the Square.  It is lined with restaurants and cafes, many outdoors.  There is a central structure in the Square that has been converted into a small café.  Tables and chairs await you.  On the morning we were there, two guitarists were practicing something new and working out the kinks in their harmonies.

1064,"Small little cute beautiful park.  Everybody who have ever checked ""Montreal"", you guys already know this park without knowing it.  Check the photos I just put up. During winter, it's little hard to see how beautiful this park is but Spring to Fall, you have to come here and enjoy the view, houses around park, and little veggie vendor.  The veggie vendor owner closes for winter but during the 3 other seasons, you can buy fresh Quebecois veggies and fruits.  All very cheap and fresh.  I saw many tourists took photos in front of the little stand..",5,2/7/2010,Keewi H.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-rHPIHFPIaKxYYxqTsGcbQ,"Ithaca, NY",Square Saint-Louis
1065,"Square St Louis.. I have had a place on Carre St Louis for about 9 years now and I can tell you lots of stories about what goes on in that parc, but the bottom line is that it is unique.  This is one of those really cool places where you can see all and I do mean ALL walks of life and styles meeting in one common area.  On any given warm summer day you will see mom's with their babies or toddlers, couples on a date, office people on lunch break, a roving group of squeegees, dog owners and their pets (one of which is Clooney the Vietnamese pot Belly pig), assorted musicians, and lions tigers and bears oh my!!  The part with the Tiger is only partially a joke as I personally once played with a 180lbs 11 month old tiger in said fountain, a mere 20+ years ago...The park is always very well landscaped and has been ever since Mayor botanical gardens, was around making it a very lovely place indeed.  The surrounding buildings offer any photographer/ architect student lots of material to view and discuss and one can often see groups of students getting a tour of the various buildings.You can find the row of multi coloured Victorians on the north side on many a Montreal post card, on the south side you can see the Vogel building (294), this building was once the first private hospital started by Mr Vogel, and for many years was the home of Michel Tremblay (5th floor), a renown writer who was very certainly influenced by this Square, among other Montreal locations.Also nice is the use of the building located on the ouest side (near Laval), where they make crepes,  homemade ice cream, fresh squeezed orange juice and where you will find an outdoor fruit and vegetable stand.  The little sitting area just off the cantine, is where you can sit and listen to various and varied musicians, who may or may not add a dancer to their outdoor show.If you in the area and want to have a fun day just sit and people watch, you will not be bored, to make this even better go ahead and google the Square, and surrounding buildings, you will find some interesting facts about it's rich history.",5,2/26/2012,Valerie G.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=r7GHYNcXMwCxd5SIHNBsAQ,"Montreal, Canada",Square Saint-Louis
1066,"I've been to Montreal twice now, and have made it a necessity to visit St Louis Square. Victorian inspired homes line the park. I've taken over 100+ pictures of all of the homes near and around the park. I'm sure the locals are annoyed by tourists like me, but the homes are so visually appealing that I can't help posing in front of them. My favorite is the red/blue/purple trio of homes right across the little street from the park. I also adore the homes that look like medieval castles.The park itself has dozens of benches, gorgeous trees, and my favorite - a plague of squirrels. I could spend my entire trip sitting on the benches and feeding the squirrels. I'm not sure what the rules are in Montreal in regards to squirrel feeding (I couldn't find any legitimate information), but nonetheless I have a blast feeding them.It is located right by the subway station Sherbrooke and is close to Mont Royal (a wicked shopping spot).

The riverside parks and Verdun and LaSalle have been packed solid the past few days because of the warm weather. Runners, joggers, bikers, strollers, families doing BBQ and picnics, kids, couples, guys hanging out downing a couple of brewskis together, they've all been here in droves. I've seen very, very few people keeping the social distance rules or wearing the required masks. I don't think people seem to understand the gravity of this pandemic and are just treating the warm days as some kind of vacation holiday.

Available parking in the lot next to Crescendo, but plenty of possibility to park in the street too so driving to enjoy this park is perfectly reasonable. Nice pedestrian bridge in the area, the path goes along near the water with many benches and lovely grassy spots to throw a blanket for a picnic. There is also a boat launch area that many people were trying to access today (finally a super nice day!!)...but unfortunately city workers had it blocked off temporarily to place buoys (surely as part of the flood warning measures).

1074,"All roads lead to the canal and this is one of the many entry points to the canal.  It's the closest one to me so we use it often.  Also, if you've been walking a while and need a little pick me up, just head up Peel as there are several places to grab a quick snack (Starbucks, La Bete a Pain, Dairy Queen, along with several restaurants), before you continue on your trek along the canal. If you want a healthier option, there is a gym that has a snack counter that makes smoothies and other power drinks.I wish I knew more of the history to share other than this area used to be no mans land but had become an up and coming area if it's not already there with its fabulous food scene and designer interior decor boutiques. It's a beautiful mix of old and new. On one side you have  great views of the famous Farine Five Roses building.

1075,"Parc des Compagnons de Saint-Laurent is a-ok!  Not amazing, not horrible either.  Green space is always a good thing, and this park is a welcome oasis on Mont-Royal, just East of Papineau.  Lots of benches, a few picnic tables, and a gigantic communal stone picnic table, make it a great place to stop and savor a croissant from Copains D'abord, a gelato from Peche Glace or even a sausage sandwich from William Walter.  Where we find it a bit lacking is in the play structures: there isn't much variety, and what there is isn't all that fun (at least not to me, nor to my 3yo who isn't so into swings).  But there's sand, and that's a big draw in our family. And during the summer there's the Ludotheque, a shipping crate full of toys to borrow and play with, books to read, and assorted other fun stuff to make up for the play structures that don't get us all that excited.",3,9/10/2018,Amanda C.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,"Montreal, Canada",Parc des Compagnons de Saint-Laurent
1076,"La Fontaine is relatively small community park space that has everything for the locals to enjoy active time. Starting with the tennis courts that can be booked through the municipality and swimming pool that operates through the summer months. Then comes the dogs park, which is hidden in between the trees and the boule playground, both areas allowing residents to congregate based on their interests. There are also two playgrounds for the kiddos that were recently renovated. My favorite in the park remains the ice skating rink. It is the traditional outdoor rink, no refrigeration, fully relying on favorable weather conditions. I actually ended up skating once at it and my sweetheart even practiced his hockey skills for an hour. It is relatively well maintained, at night it is illuminated and one can see people playing the favorite Canadian sport quite often. During the day parents brings their little ones for their first ice skating experiences. The park has relatively big parking lot, making the access to all the facilities easy for folks who are not residents of IDS, besides the fact IDS is accessible by public transportation, meaning bus.",4,11/15/2020,Dessi V.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Zoec9wehLFa8CV1JnCCVug,"Verdun, Canada",Parc La Fontaine

LOTS of walking in small paths with TOO MANY People as they oversold this. 3. The ""Light Show"" consists of some balloon animals lit up in the pond and lighting along the long and winding paths. Laserium in the '70's was way better and that was corny even back then. 4.

How many mud puddles did I step in, I couldn't tell the difference between this dark grassy (super wet) area to the dark leafy (dry) area. The Chinese garden is huge but very slippery in the rain.This happens two months of the year: all of September and all of October. When the sun goes down, the lights are up.The lights are extremely bright and colourful. It's not like traditional Chinese lantern festivals, it's much more modern and child-like. Areas that are lid are:- the path leading into the garden- the entire Chinese garden- all waters of the Chinese garden have lanterns- all corners of the Chinese garden have lanterns- on the rims of buildings and structures- on the trees- on the rocks- the Japanese house beside the Japanese gardenIt's not just a display of 1-2 panda lanterns, each set has its own theme! It's very cute. It gets REALLY dark even with all the lights, because you can't see where you're stepping.

If all else fails, the line was really long, but it seemed to move fairly quickly so it shouldn't be too bad. I really thought this place was going to be really cool to check out, and it was, but it was difficult to enjoy. It was crowded, overly crowded, like they let waaayy too many people in. At times it was hard to see, there was lots of bumping into people. It just really reminded me of a concert atmosphere, except I didn't have a drink in my hand and there was no music. Speaking of which I really felt the whole night could've used some kind of background music, I personally felt it was missing. Maybe thats just me being overly critical.We came a couple weeks ago when it was a really unexpectedly warm night. With the crowds it was a lot of waiting to see the next display, waiting to get to restrooms, and waiting to get to a vendor. It was just so slow moving. The area got warm quick, and all I wanted was some water. The vendors were few and far between, and NO ONE sold water! To top it off there were lots of bugs, and they kept annoying me the whole night. By the time we got close to the end, we were over it. My friend even wanted to take the emergency exit to get out faster. All in all, it was beautiful to see but it was hard to enjoy it.
